<p>Given the challenges involved in obtaining, trapping and screening wild animals for serum sampling and sero-prevalence studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the collection of blood fed mosquitoes is a useful means of sampling, with mosquitoes acting as an indirect sampling tool or "flying syringe” for sampling inaccessible or ethically challenging hosts. In terms of pathway incrimination, a single mosquito will yield information on vectors, host preference and the disease exposure of that host [
 <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. That information, especially when combined with risk modelling [
 <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] can be used to identify those transmission pathways of greatest importance within the host community. Various studies have observed the potential for insect blood meals to detect pathogen specific antibodies [
