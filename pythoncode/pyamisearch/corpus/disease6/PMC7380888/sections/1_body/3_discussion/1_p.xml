<p>Mosquito blood meals are a potentially useful resource for assessing antibody seroprevalence in vertebrates and inferring the RRV transmission pathways between vectors, disease reservoirs and humans. This study demonstrates that a micro-PRNT using 96-well plates has considerable utility for characterizing the antibody content of small blood volumes and is equivalent in sensitivity and specificity to the "gold standard‚Äù conventional PRNT method. In conjunction with the species identification of the blood-fed mosquito, and the use of existing molecular tools to identify the host origin of the blood meal, this new diagnostic has the capacity to increase our understanding of the key pathways for the transmission of complex zoonotic arboviruses.</p>
