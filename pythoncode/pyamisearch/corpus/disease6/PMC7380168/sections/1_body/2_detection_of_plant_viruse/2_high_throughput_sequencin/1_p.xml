<p>The advent of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies, also known as next-generation sequencing, has led to a revolution in plant virus diagnosis (

 <xref rid="B251" ref-type="bibr">Villamor et al., 2019</xref>). HTS does not require any previous knowledge of viral sequences and can sequence millions or billions of DNA molecules in parallel, enabling the detection of all viruses present in a plant (virome), including those still unknown (

 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2015</xref>), but often it is not possible to find a direct association between the disease and a particular virus (
 <xref rid="B241" ref-type="bibr">Tomašechová et al., 2020</xref>) among those detected in the infected plant. In this case, the diagnostic must be established by fulfilling Koch's postulates, or at least by finding a tight association between the disease and the presence of a certain virus in field surveys (
