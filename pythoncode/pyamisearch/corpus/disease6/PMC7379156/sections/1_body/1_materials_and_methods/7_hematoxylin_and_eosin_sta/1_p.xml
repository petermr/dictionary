<p>Pancreas, spleen, uterus, and ovary were excised from mice. The tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, subjected to alcohol dehydration, and embedded in paraffin as described previously (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Rhee et al., 2012</xref>). The paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned into 5 μm slices using a microtome (Leica RM2235, Nussloch, Germany). The tissue sections were mounted on glass slides and allowed to dry overnight at 40°C. The slides were further incubated for 30 min at 60°C to melt the paraffin. The slides were then further deparaffinized with xylene for 30 min and subjected to rehydration steps involving treatment with decreasing ethanol concentrations from 100 to 70% in distilled water. After rehydration, the slides were stained with Gill's Hematoxylin V (Muto Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan), washed under flowing tap water for 15 min, and counterstained with Eosin Y solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States). The slides were then dehydrated with a series of increasing concentrations of ethanol (70–100%). Then, the slides were treated with xylene and mounted with a 6:4 solution of Malinol (Muto Pure Chemicals) and xylene. Finally, images of the stained sections were captured using an Eclipse E200 microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).
