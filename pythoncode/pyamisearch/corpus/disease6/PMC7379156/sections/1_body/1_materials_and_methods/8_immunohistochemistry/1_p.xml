<p>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were prepared, deparaffinized, and rehydrated. The rehydrated slides were incubated with 3% H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States. Catalogue No: TA-125-H2O2Q) for 15 min. Then, antigen retrieval was carried out by boiling the slides in citrate buffer (pH 6.0: ScyTek Laboratories, West Logan, UT, United States) for 15 min. The slides were then washed three times with PBST and subjected to sequential blocking with avidin blocker, biotin blocker (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, United States. Catalog No: SP-2001), and normal horse serum (Vector Laboratories, Catalog No: S-2000), each for 15 min. Then, each slide was incubated with rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, United States, Catalog No: 9661S) for 2 h. The slides were then washed and incubated with biotinylated horse anti-rabbit antibody (Vector Laboratories, Catalog No: BP 1100) for 30 min. Following incubation, the slides were washed and treated with HRP-streptavidin (Vector Laboratories, Catalog No: PK-6100). After a 30 min incubation, the enzyme-substrate reaction was developed using 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The slides were further counterstained with Gill's Hematoxylin V, dehydrated (70–100% ethanol treatment), treated with xylene, and mounted. Finally, images were taken with an Eclipse E200 microscope. All staining procedures were carried out at room temperature.
