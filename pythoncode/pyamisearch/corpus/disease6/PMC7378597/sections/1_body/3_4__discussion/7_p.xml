<p>As shown in previous reports, the initial HIV outbreak in FSU countries occurred in the mid-1990s in the city of Odessa, Ukraine, and spread to other countries of FSU [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Our phylogenetic tree also shows the ancestral node for the HIV subtype A epidemic originating from Ukrainian sequences deposited in 1993 (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), whereas the Bayesian analysis also predicts the origins of the epidemic to be around the same time (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These results might indicate that Odessa had a favourable location for an explosive spread of HIV among PWID, as the city is situated on the Black Sea shore and was a major seaport and transportation hub during that period [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the first postcollapse decade, there was an increase in injection drug use in the FSU [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], linked to the rise of drug production in Afghanistan during the mid-1990s and a shift in trafficking to the "Northern route,” which runs through Central Asia to Russia and South Caucasus to Eastern Europe [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This increase in drug trafficking may have played a role in the early spread of HIV among PWID communities. Our phylogenetic tree also shows a high number of transmissions associated with drug use, later shifting the mode of transmission toward heterosexual sex. Furthermore, our phylogenetic analysis shows heavy intermixing of Armenian PWID sequences from the South Caucasian region, which is within "Northern route” of drug trafficking, with other Eastern European sequences. During the period of 1989–2001, another important scenario that may have facilitated transmission of HIV and HCV was the displacement of a population of about one million Armenians in aftermath of the 1988 earthquake, coupled with deteriorating socioeconomic situation in the 1990s. These displaced labor populations immigrated mainly to the Eastern European countries of Ukraine, Belarus, and Eastern part of Russia [
