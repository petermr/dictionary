<p>This study has some limitations. First, our estimation is based on predicted mosquito population density rather than empirical data which was impossible to obtain due to a lack of consistent and sensitive mosquito survey, and rarely available due to typically heterogeneous distributions over highly focal geographic area exhibited by both these species. Second, we cannot strictly compare our estimates of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>hv</italic>
 </sub>, and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> to those published as the calculation depends on the model used and the geographical locations. In addition, we have not dissociated genders in the equation of sexual transmission, as the proportion of male to female transmission is higher than vice-versa [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Moreover, we have not considered human mobility, which is an important factor in arbovirus transmission.

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>hh</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>

 </sub> give a picture of the epidemic potential at time 
 <italic>t</italic>, once an infected person is introduced, and therefore, we cannot indicate how the established outbreaks will behave (fade out, sustain or peak). The mean maximum mosquito lifespan (age of the oldest survivor) is difficult to observe under field conditions. Mousson et al (2010) estimated 
 <italic>Ae albopictus</italic>'s lifespan, however we argue that the appropriate term in their study should be "life expectancy”, not "lifespan”. Therefore, we assumed the same lifespan used in Gao et al (2016) for both vectors. We integrated a range of vector control rates, which broadly pictured the effect of relevant mosquito control in Australia. Notably, as recently introduced 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection in some Australian populations of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> would likely impact the ability of mosquitoes to transmit ZIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], it would be beneficial to consider the impact of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection on transmission potential across relevant locations. One of the sources of parameter uncertainty in EUFRAT is the uncertainty around population incidence due to misdiagnosis, underreporting, lack of laboratory confirmation and proportion of asymptomatic cases. Nonetheless, misdiagnosis and underreporting issues that are common during ZIKV epidemics due to non-specific clinical presentation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], do not affect our risk assessment because we are not estimating 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> with case notifications. While in the absence of empirical data, the risk estimates are valuable, the inherent uncertainties challenge the interpretation of their significance [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Finally, we simplified the infectious period of ZIKV to a single parameter based on a median 14 days from symptom onset till loss of viral RNA in serum [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is thought that presymptomatic transmission may occur and others have attempted to include this parameter in modelling efforts [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The effect of not including presymptomatic transmission directly in our estimation is likely to be minimal because we used a long symptomatic infectious period compared with other models.
