<p>To limit the risk of any ZIKV case in Australia and more importantly of foetal blood transfusion resulting in permanent disability, i) mosquito surveillance and vector control programs should be sustained and tailored to reduce the mosquito population density (

In any event of ZIKV outbreak, however, blood donors, who have visited the outbreak area, would be restricted to plasma for fractionation for 28 days post-exposure. Moreover, to mitigate infectious risk to blood safety, in event of infectious disease outbreak, Queensland Health Department notifies the Lifeblood by following an infectious disease outbreak protocol.
