<p>In our previous study, we found that blood donations were predominantly distributed around the large urban centres of Sydney and Melbourne, which did not have epidemic potential for ZIKV by either mosquito species [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Local transmission of ZIKV in Cairns, Rockhampton or Townsville presented the highest risk to the blood supply, although these combined locations represent only 4.5% of the annual mean number of blood donations in Australia. Of the UCLs where outbreaks are presently possible due to the presence of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, Cairns, and Rockhampton are the most at risk of having infected blood components obtained from individual donations with the 'worst-'case scenario (noting that Rockhampton is the only region without predominantly 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected strains of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> which may reduce transmission). Moreover, a risk of infected blood components obtained from individual donations would arise in Darwin, if 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> was to re-establish. If 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> was established, the possibility of having infected blood components obtained from individual donations would only be possible with the 'worst-'case scenario in Darwin UCL. By use of the most conservative estimates ('worst-case' scenario), the risk of collecting a viraemic donation could have been as high as one in 992,681 (in Darwin in 2010 with 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>), and one in 4,448,512 (again in Darwin in 2014 with 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>), which are still very low risks.
