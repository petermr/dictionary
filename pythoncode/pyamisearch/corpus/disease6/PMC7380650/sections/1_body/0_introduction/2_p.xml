<p>ZIKV belongs to the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus (family 
 <italic>Flaviridae</italic>), along with DENVs and WNV, and is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected female 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> or 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquito. Both species are principal vectors of DENVs and chikungunya virus (CHIKV). The former species is established in north Queensland and present in some towns in central and southern Queensland [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The latter species is not yet established in mainland Australia but is present on many Torres Strait islands [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], although as many as 80% of cases may be asymptomatic [50–80%][

 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. When acquired during pregnancy, ZIKV can cause miscarriage or neurological birth defects (e.g. microcephaly) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, ZIKV may also cause Guillain-Barré syndrome [
