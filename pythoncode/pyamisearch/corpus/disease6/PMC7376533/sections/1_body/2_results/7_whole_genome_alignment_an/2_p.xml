<p id="Par39">We then generated alignments between the genome sequence of strain BJDX-01-2015 and those of strains HAdV-B55, HAdV-B11, and HAdV-B14. Most of the nucleotide differences in BJDX-01-2015 relative to HAdV-B/CHN/BJ01/2011/55 (GenBank accession number JX491639) were observed in the coding region of protein VI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a), where we found seven nucleotide changes and six amino acid substitutions. We also found different numbers of poly "T” and ploy "A” tracts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b).
