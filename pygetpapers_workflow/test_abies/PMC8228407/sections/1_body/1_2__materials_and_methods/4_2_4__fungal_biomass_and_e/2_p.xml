<p>For the enzyme assays, 250 mg of freeze-dried wood powder was extracted with 12 mL of 50 mM acetate buffer (pH 5) for 2 h at 4 °C on an orbital shaker (100 rpm). The obtained extract was diluted with 6 mL of acetate buffer and used for the subsequent enzymatic analyses. The activities of β-glucosidase, β-xylosidase, β-galactosidase, cellobiohydrolase (exocellulase), α-glucosidase, 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminidase, phosphomonoesterase (phosphatase) and esterase (lipase) were measured by a direct assay method as previously described [
 <xref rid="B42-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Briefly, the sample extract was incubated with several substrates specific for each enzyme. These substrates were conjugated with fluorescent 4-methylumbellyferol, which allows the determination of enzyme activity based on the detected fluorescence. Fluorescence was recorded at an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. The activities of endo−1,4-β-glucanase (endocellulase) and endo-1,4-β-xylanase (endoxylanase) were measured with azo-dyed carbohydrate substrates (carboxymethyl cellulose and birchwood xylan, respectively) according to the substrate supplier’s instructions (Megazyme, Ireland). Briefly, 150 μL of dyed substrate was incubated with 150 μL of sample extract, and the amount of released dye was measured spectrophotometrically at 595 nm. The activities of laccase and manganese peroxidase were determined by evaluating the oxidation of 2,2-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid with a spectrophotometer at 420 nm and the oxidative coupling of 3-methyl-2-benzothizolinohydrazine and 3,3-dimetylaminobenzoic acid at 595 nm, respectively [
