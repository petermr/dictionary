<p>The effect of tree species, decay class and their interaction on the chemical properties of deadwood, ergosterol content, enzymatic activities and diversity indices were tested by two-way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer HSD tests or non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests. The effect of decay class was also evaluated for each tree species separately using one-way ANOVAs. Spearman's correlations and general linear models were used to identify the relationships between ergosterol content and enzyme activities and ergosterol content and the carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio.</p>
