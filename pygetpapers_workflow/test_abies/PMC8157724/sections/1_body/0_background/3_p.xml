<p id="Par19">Although PEMs is generally initiated from the immature zygotic embryos in conifers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], recent studies have also reported SE initiation from the primordial shoot explants and matured embryos of SE plants in 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and 
 <italic>Picea glauca (P. glauca</italic>, White spruce,) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Protocols are well established for the induction of SE in various angiosperm plants and gymnosperms including coniferous tree species, yet the information on underlying genetic regulatory mechanism is largely missing. SE in conifers can in most cases be induced by treating the primary explants with plant growth regulators e.g. auxin (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) and cytokinin (N6-benzyladenine), or also by wounding or other stress factors e.g. temperature, heavy metal ions, starvation or osmotic stress [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Molecular mechanisms governing the regeneration in the explants of coniferous forest tree species with a focus on interaction between auxin and stress conditions have been reviewed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Ectopic and/or over expression of the key transcription factors involved in the development of SE might also give rise to somatic embryos (discussed in the later part of "Background‚Äù).
