<p>The antibacterial effects of the spruce bark extracts were more evident against Gram-positive bacteria, all of the experimental variants having similar efficiencies against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (methicillin sensitive and resistant), with M1 M and MD M variants being slightly more efficient against these strains. Although, the extracts' activity against Gram-negative bacteria was clearly weaker, the growth inhibition of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumonia,</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> still occurred for some of the experimental variants at higher MICs.
