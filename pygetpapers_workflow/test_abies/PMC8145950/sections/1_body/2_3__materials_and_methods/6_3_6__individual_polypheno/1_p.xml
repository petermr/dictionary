<p>The individual phenolic compounds from the tested extracts were identified and quantified using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). The detector used for the UPLC analysis consisted in a photodiode array (PDA) detector. Chromatographic separation was performed at 35 °C on a Luna C18 (2) 150 × 4.6 mm, 3 µm column (Phenomenex). The mobile phase consisted of a mixture of formic acid 0.1% (A) and acetonitrile (B). The gradient ellution was: 0–0.1 min: 90% A, 10% B; 0.1–20.1 min: 90%→ 20% A; 20.1–25.1 min: 20% A; 25.1–26.1 min: 20% A → 90% A; 26.1–30.1 min: 90% A. The flow rate was 1 mL/min and the injection volume was 20 µL. The 210 nm, 280 nm, and 370 nm wavelengths were monitored. The identification process consisted in the comparison of the retention times of the peaks on the standard solution chromatogram with those on the extracts’ chromatograms. The compounds associated with each peak were then quantified based on the peak area and identified based on the similarity of UV spectra when compared to standard solutions. This method was also described in our previous study [
