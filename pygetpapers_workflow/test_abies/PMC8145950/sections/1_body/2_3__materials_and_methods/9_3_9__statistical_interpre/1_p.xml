<p>The differences that occurred between the variants' TPC, TTC, AC, and volatile compounds content were statistically interpreted using a one-way ANOVA test to detect potential differences in the means of the data sets. Afterward, Tukey's post hoc test was performed if any mean difference occurred, to identify the specific variants that significantly differ (significance level α = 0.05, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) from each other. A Pearson correlation test was also performed to assess the linear correlation between the TPC and the AC of the extracts. These tests were performed in the GraphPad Prism 8 statistical software.
