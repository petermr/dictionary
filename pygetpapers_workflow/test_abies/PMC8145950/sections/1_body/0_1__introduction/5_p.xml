<p>However, in order to use these phytochemicals, for their beneficial effects, they must be extracted from the vegetal matrices first. For a long time, traditional methods like maceration and Soxhlet extraction were used for extraction. Still, these methods proved to be time and energy consuming [

 <xref rid="B10-plants-10-00870" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) is commonly used as it does not require complex equipment and is simple to use, while efficiently solving the problems of the classic methods, but compared to other modern methods this one is the most time and solvent consuming [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00870" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This method is based on the cavitation process caused by the ultrasounds passing through the solvent. The process leads to the formation of cavitation bubbles near the surface of the vegetal matrix. When these bubbles collapse they damage the cellular walls’ structure, increasing the contact surface of the matrix and solvent by increasing the cellular wall permeability, thus enhancing the diffusion process and extraction yield [

The microwave assisted extraction (MAE) on the other hand uses the energy of the microwave radiation to heat the entire sample volume (solvent and matrix) at once. The fast raise of internal temperature in the vegetal matrix leads to an increased intracellular pressure which damages the cellular walls, releasing the internal cellular content, while the raise in solvent temperature accelerates the diffusion process [
