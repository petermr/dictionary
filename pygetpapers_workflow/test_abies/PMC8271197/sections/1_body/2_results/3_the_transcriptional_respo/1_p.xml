<p>To explore the biological processes involved in the transcriptome response to drought, 13 clusters representing co-expressed sets of genes were identified and functional annotations were assigned to these (
 <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3a and </xref>
 <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="sup8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Tables S1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="sup9" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>, available as Supplementary data at 
 <italic toggle="yes">Tree Physiology</italic> Online, for gene clusters primarily up- or down-regulated in response to drought, respectively). Gene Ontology terms are assigned to ~34% of the DEGs, and GOSlim terms were used to provide a global overview of the biological processes induced in response to drought in needles and roots (
 <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3b and </xref>
 <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). The GOSlim term ‘response to stress’ (GO:0006950) was significantly enriched (
 <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in Cluster 3 (
 <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>), which contained genes commonly up-regulated in both needles and roots in response to severe drought. Cluster 10 (
 <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>) comprised a large set of genes specifically down-regulated in roots during severe drought, with this down-regulation reversed upon re-irrigation, indicating recovery from water stress. This cluster was significantly enriched (
 <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) for GOSlim terms associated with growth including ‘anatomical structure development’ (GO:0048856), ‘transport’ (GO:0006810), ‘reproduction’ (GO:0000003), ‘carbohydrate metabolic process’ (GO:0005975), ‘cell wall organisation or biogenesis’ (GO:0071554), ‘DNA metabolic process’ (GO:0006259), ‘chromosome organization’ (GO:0051276), ‘cell differentiation’ (GO:0030154), ‘cell cycle’ (GO:0007049), ‘growth’ (GO:0040007), ‘anatomical structure formation involved in morphogenesis’ (GO:0048646), ‘cell morphogenesis’ (GO:0000902), ‘developmental maturation’ (GO:0021700), ‘cell division’ (GO:0051301), ‘cell proliferation’ (GO:0008283) and ‘pigmentation’ (GO:0043473). As such, active down-regulation of growth appeared to be an important component of the drought-response mechanisms in the roots of Norway spruce seedlings. Finally, ‘response to stress’ (GO:0006950) was significantly enriched (
 <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in Cluster 11 (
 <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>), combining DE genes down-regulated in roots both during severe drought and after re-irrigation.
