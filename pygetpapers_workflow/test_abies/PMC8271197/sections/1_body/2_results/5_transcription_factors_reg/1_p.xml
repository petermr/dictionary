<p>Among the DEGs in needles and roots were 74 and 240 TFs, respectively (

Notably, the bZIP AREB/ABF (ABRE binding/ABFs) TFs of the ABA-dependent pathway, which are key regulators of angiosperm drought-response, were not DE. Two genes with sequence similarity to Arabidopsis ABFs were expressed (MA_18107g0010, MA_61649g0010), but both displayed small, non-significant increases in expression in response to severe drought in both needles and roots. The canonical ABF binding motif was present in the available promoter region of several genes; however, these were not consistently DE in response to drought (
