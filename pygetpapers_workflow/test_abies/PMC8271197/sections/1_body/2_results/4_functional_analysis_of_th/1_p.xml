<p>Arabidopsis is the most comprehensively characterized species for a range of abiotic stresses, including drought. To ascertain how relevant biological annotation of genes in this model system is for informing studies in Norway spruce, sequence homology analysis was performed. Arabidopsis orthologs were identified for 13% (184 of 1400) and 14% (888 of 6160) of DEGs in needles and roots, respectively, and homologs were identified for 57 and 55%, respectively (
