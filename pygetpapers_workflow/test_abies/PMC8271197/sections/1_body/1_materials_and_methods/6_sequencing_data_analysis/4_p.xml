<p>Clusters of DEGs were identified using ComplexHeatmap (
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al. 2016</xref>) in R, after calculating the mean expression for each sampling point using vst values. Default method for clustering was ‘hclust’, and ‘euclidean’ distance and vst values were scaled by row means. Thirteen clusters separated up- and down-regulated genes by tissue and time point. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations were obtained from the Conifer Genome Integrative Explorer (ConGenIE;
