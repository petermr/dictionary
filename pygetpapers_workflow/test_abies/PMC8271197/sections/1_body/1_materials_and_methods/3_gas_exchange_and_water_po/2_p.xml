 <sub>s</sub> over time in the treated plants were tested with one-way repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the package nlme (

 <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Hothorn et al. 2008</xref>) with Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test. Differences in water potential were assessed with a one-way ANOVA and with time as the factor. A per-time comparison 
 <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test was then applied to test significant differences between measurements of control plants and water-stressed plants. Significant differences were assigned at
