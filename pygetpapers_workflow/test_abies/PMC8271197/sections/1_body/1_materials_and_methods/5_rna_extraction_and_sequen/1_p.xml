<p>The same plants used for water potential and ABA measurements were sampled for the analysis of the drought transcriptome. At Days 0, 2, 4, 5, 13, 18, 21 and 25 of the treatment, needles and roots of three to four seedlings were collected on dry ice and stored at −80 °C until further processing. They were ground manually in liquid nitrogen, and total RNA was prepared after 
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al. (1993)</xref> with modifications as detailed in 
 <xref rid="ref84" ref-type="bibr">Street et al. (2006)</xref>. The RNA was further purified using the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer’s instructions. A DNase digestion with the RNase-free DNase set (QIAGEN) was performed. RNA was eluted in 40 μl of RNase-free water for 2 min at room temperature. Integrity of total RNA was assessed with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies) and purity was measured with a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). High-quality total RNA with a RNA Integrity Number (RIN) ≥7.5, Optical Density(OD) 260/280 ratio of ≥2.0 and concentrations ≥50 ng μl
 <sup>−1</sup> was sequenced by SciLifeLab (Stockholm, Sweden) for paired-end (2 × 125 bp) sequencing on a HiSeq 2000 platform using standard Illumina protocols. The sequencing library preparation included an enrichment for poly-adenylated mRNAs, and all samples each yielded &gt;12.4 million read pairs.
