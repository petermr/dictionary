<p>The limited physiological response of needles to severe drought was reflected in the transcriptome, with substantially fewer DEGs in needles than in roots (
 <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). This was despite very similar increases in ABA levels in both tissues, suggesting either that the observed increase in ABA was coincidental rather than controlling the induced transcriptional responses or that the two tissues have differential sensitivity to ABA. The known importance of ABA in regulating drought response together with the observed correlation between ABA levels and the predominant expression profile induced by severe drought in both tissues points toward different transcriptional responses being induced by the common ABA signal in the two tissues. In contrast to the needle response, changes in the transcriptome of roots were observed starting at 30% FC, with the response being particularly prominent in response to severe drought (Day 18;

Correspondingly, a greater number of biological processes were significantly altered in roots, particularly categories associated with growth and development. Nevertheless, there was a common enrichment in both tissues of up-regulated genes for ‘response to stress’, indicating a core stress response program around which a root-specific extensive down-regulation of genes involved in growth was induced. This is in line with the finding that drought response in conifers is highly dependent on established roots, with the development of new roots being restricted due to carbon costs (

 <xref rid="ref100" ref-type="bibr">Zlobin et al. 2018</xref>). In needles, metabolism remained largely unchanged, with no enrichment for terms associated with the primary physiological mechanisms of photosynthesis. 
 <xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">Pashkovskiy et al. (2019</xref>) reported ABA levels in Norway spruce and Scots pine roots and needles in response to drought, finding significantly higher baseline ABA levels and more substantial induction in Norway spruce needles than roots. The current results contrast in that similar ABA levels and extents of increase were recorded in both tissues (
 <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). Further experiments will be needed to determine whether the differences observed in the two studies arise from the substantially different experimental setups used to induce drought stress (water deprivation in the current study and polyethylene glycol within a hydroponic system for Pashkovskiy et al.) or result from genotypic variation.
