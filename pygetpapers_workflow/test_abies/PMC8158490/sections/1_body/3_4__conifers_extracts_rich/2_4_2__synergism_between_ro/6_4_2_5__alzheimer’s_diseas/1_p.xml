<p>AD is a common neurodegenerative disease that affects 80% of the elderly population, accounting for about half of all dementia cases and ultimately results in death [
 <xref rid="B186-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. Its symptoms include failure to learn, gradual memory loss, and deterioration in behavior and neuronal function [
 <xref rid="B187-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. Regarding treatment, only five approved treatment options are licensed in the European Union for the treatment of AD, including rivastigmine, donepezil (cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs), galantamine, and memantine (NMDAR antagonist) [
 <xref rid="B188-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. An antimitotic agent paclitaxel widely used for the treatment of lung, ovarian and breast cancer has also been investigated as a possible treatment for AD [
 <xref rid="B189-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. It is mainly effective in the treatment of tauopathies, which are disorders caused by mutations in the tau protein, which is abundant in central nervous system (CNS) cells and acts by stabilizing microtubules [
 <xref rid="B190-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. The consumption of polyphenol-rich foods or beverages has been related to the prevention of AD in distinct studies [
 <xref rid="B191-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. The accumulation of amyloid-(A) in brain and leptomeningeal vessels causes cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which is also a central component of neuritic plaques in AD amyloid-(A) and has been related to the pathogenesis of two of the most common forms of dementia: AD and CAA. As a result, Aβ should be a top priority in the treatment of these diseases, which currently have no effective therapies [
 <xref rid="B192-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>]. Taxifolin, an antioxidant and anti-glycation flavonoid, reduces Aβ aggregation and its accumulation in the cerebrovascular system. In vitro studies have shown that taxifolin facilitates Aβ clearance in the brain, prevents Aβ fibril formation and CAA cognitive loss, and increases cerebral blood flow [
 <xref rid="B193-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>]. The methanol extract of 
 <italic>P. roxburghii</italic> bark contains bioactive compounds, such as quercetin and gallic acid, which play important roles in neuroprotection by reversing mitochondrial dysfunction, free radical formation, and improving memory and cognition in rats, as well as reducing oxidative stress by improving acetylcholine levels. Furthermore, anti-AD activity has been documented in 
 <italic>Pinus</italic> species, such as 
 <italic>P. halepensis</italic> and 
 <italic>P. massoniana</italic> [
 <xref rid="B194-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>]. Piceatannol, a compound derived from pine bark, has proven to be effective in preventing AD [
 <xref rid="B195-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>]. Resveratrol (RV), a stilbenoid, protects neurons from oxidative damage in a variety of ways, such as lowering lipid peroxidation and increasing intracellular antioxidant levels including antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) [
 <xref rid="B196-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. In this way, RV acts as an anti-AD agent by reducing neuroinflammation, inhibiting Aβ-plaque formation and tauopathy, and as a result inhibits neuronal death and improves memory [
 <xref rid="B197-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>]. Pycnogenol derived from 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic> bark has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, including inhibition of amyloid-induced neuron apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B198-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. When the effect of pycnogenol was investigated in AD-related pathology in a β-amyloidosis mouse model, a decline in plaque numbers was found, while no changes were reported in the soluble β-amyloidosis levels, astrocytes, neurons, microglia, myelination pattern, morphology of axons and the gene expression of APP-processing enzymes [
 <xref rid="B199-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>]. Hence, it is suggested that pycnogenol has potential use in the prevention or in early stages of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [
