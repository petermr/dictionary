<p>Cupressuflavone (CUF) isolated from 
 <italic>C. macrocarpa</italic> has the ability to reduce the levels of several cytokines, including IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-α and PGE2, in plasma dose-dependently, and thus acts as an anti-inflammatory agent [

 <italic>Abies chensiensis</italic> show anti-inflammatory effects against NO production in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells [

 <italic>Taxus</italic> spp. are effective in the anti-inflammatory process initiated through the carrageenan and cotton pellets induced edema model [

 <italic>Picea wilsonii</italic> mast extract is useful and potent only in the inhibition of the production of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6, MCP-1 and IL-13, without significant change in IL-8 production induced in human adult low-calcium high-temperature (HaCaT) cell lines [

 <italic>T. occidentalis</italic> mother tincture-containing terpenoids (thujone), polyphenols and flavanoids have potential in reducing ulcerative colitis inflammation in the mouse intestine and rectum by decreasing the stimulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6 and TNF-α induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) [

THP-1 cell adhesion to TNF was suppressed by enzogenol at a concentration of 5–25 g/mL onto TNF-α-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) by reducing integrin β2 induction and inhibiting monocyte trans-endothelial migration [
