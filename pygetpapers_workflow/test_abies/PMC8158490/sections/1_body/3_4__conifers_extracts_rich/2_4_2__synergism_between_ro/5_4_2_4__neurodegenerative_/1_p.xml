<p>Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are more common among the elderly and may even lead to death, and so are a major threat in the 21st century [
 <xref rid="B175-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. AD, Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia, and the spinocerebellar ataxias are examples of ND [
 <xref rid="B176-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>], whose main features include nitrosative/oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, aggregated proteins accumulation, synapse loss, neuro-inflammation and decreased neuronal survival [
 <xref rid="B177-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. The progression of ND is also affected by genetic and surrounding ecological factors [
 <xref rid="B175-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. Indeed, it has been stated that the appropriate mechanism behind the cause of ND is mitochondrial dynamics variation, which elevates the oxidative damage, altering the biological activity of respiratory complexes, which results in brain energy dysfunction [
 <xref rid="B178-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. These stimuli trigger cellular stress, which leads to the synthesis and release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), as well as the activation of transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein), with consequent expression of Arc (synaptic plasticity), PGC-1 (cellular energy metabolism), and APE1 (DNA repair enzyme), as well as the activation of the tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk B) receptor family and other downstream protein kinases [
