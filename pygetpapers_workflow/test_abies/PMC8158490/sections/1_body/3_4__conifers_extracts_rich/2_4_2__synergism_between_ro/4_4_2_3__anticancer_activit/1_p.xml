<p>According to the report by the World Health Organization, cancer was a major cause of death in 2018, with a death rate of 9.6 million people [

 <xref rid="B130-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. On the basis of evidence, bone cancer was identified in Ancient Egyptian mummies in around 1600 B.C., and cancer of the breast was identified in 1500 B.C., although there is no record of a cure for cancer [
 <xref rid="B131-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. Giovanni's research laid the foundation for scientific cancer techniques in 1761, when he performed the first autopsies on dead human bodies to determine the connection between a patient's disease and their death, as well as pathologic studies [
 <xref rid="B132-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Cancer has been identified as the chief matter of public health concern around the world [
 <xref rid="B133-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy are some of the conventional cancer treatments [

 <xref rid="B135-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. On the other hand, despite the use of a variety of synthetic drugs for cancer treatment and the successful completion of different management schedules, current therapies are not able to achieve the desired results, as tumor relapse and metastasis are common [
 <xref rid="B136-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Nature contains various chemicals and pharmacologically active substances which act as anticancer drugs [
 <xref rid="B137-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. Recently, many of the phytochemicals and synthetic analogs, such as HS-1793 (resveratrol), have been identified as inhibiting the growth of cells and inducing apoptotic cell death, helping to cure cancer [
 <xref rid="B138-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. While only a few phytochemical compounds obtained from natural products have been developed into clinically active drugs, their bioactive components may be used as a basis for the development of more successful analogues and prodrugs using chemical techniques such as metabolomics, complete or combinatorial fabrication, and biosynthetic pathway modification [
 <xref rid="B139-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Many phytochemical compounds are highly efficient in inducing apoptosis and cytotoxicity by modulating different MAPK andAKT/PI3K pathways, and suppress cancer cells line invasion and migration potential along with the stimulation of senescence phenotype, regulation of Bax or p53 genes, cell cycle arrest and modulation of IL-8, IFN-γ, TNF, IL-6 [
 <xref rid="B140-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Many of the compounds derived from conifers' bark and leaves act as antitumor drugs, such as paclitaxel (PTX) (trade name Pycnogenol
 <sup>®</sup> and Taxol
 <sup>®</sup>), a diterpene found in the crude extract of 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic> and 
 <italic>Taxus brevifolia</italic> bark [
 <xref rid="B141-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Paclitaxel, as well as its analogues docetaxel (taxoteres) and jevtanas (cabazitaxel), are examples of chemotherapeutic synthetic analogues derivative from plants that have been formulated and validated clinically [
 <xref rid="B139-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. By binding microtubules, PTX and other microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) induce cellular death [
 <xref rid="B142-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. Microtubules are tubulin heterodimers that play a role in disease and perform numerous cellular functions including transport, force production in cell division, and structural support [
 <xref rid="B143-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. During the G2 phase of the cell cycle, tubulin is produced, and microtubules are assembled. Microtubule stabilizing agents, such as PTX, bind to α/β tubulin in order to disassemble microtubules. As a result, they cause cell death and are used as an anti-cancer agent [
 <xref rid="B144-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. In general, cells exposed to PTX are stuck in the G2/M phase, resulting in death due to failure to move through the cell cycle [

 <xref rid="B146-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Recently, a study published in 2017 found that pycnogenol and PTX at doses of 20 g/mL and 0.5 μM cause DNA and mitochondrial damage in cancer breast cell line (MDA-MB) in 24 h, and concluded that it is possibly a target drug for cancer treatment through DNA and mitochondrial damage mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B141-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. From different conifer species crude extracts, the anticancer activities on different cancer cell lines are summarized in
