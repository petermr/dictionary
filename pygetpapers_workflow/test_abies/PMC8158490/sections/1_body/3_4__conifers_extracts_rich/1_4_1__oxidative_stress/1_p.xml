<p>The role of oxidative stress in the progression of degenerative ageing is well understood. Diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, cancer, inflammation, stroke, neurological conditions (e.g., AD), and ageing have all been linked to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Both enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions are involved in the synthesis of ROS. ROS are known to be generated by enzymatic reactions present in many cell processes, including the respiratory chain system, prostaglandin synthesis and phagocytosis [
 <xref rid="B91-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. All ROS are produced through enzymatic action, including NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase and peroxidase in many cell processes, in whom the superoxide radical (O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>●−</sup>) is generated [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Different ROS, formed during enzymatic reactions and with the action of enzymes (amino acid oxidase and xanthine oxidase), include hypochlorous acid (HOCl), hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>), peroxynitrite (ONOO-), and hydroxyl radicals (OH
 <sup>●</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B93-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. The "Fenton reaction” between O
 <sup>2−</sup> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> takes place in the presence of Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> or Cu
 <sup>+</sup>, which work as catalysts, producing OH, the most reactive free radical species [
 <xref rid="B94-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The production of ROS has been related to non-enzymatic interactions between oxygen and organic compounds, as well as when cells are in contact with ionizing radiation during mitochondrial respiration [

 <xref rid="B96-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. The quest for new antioxidant molecules is a crucial part of promoting healthy ageing and combating oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B93-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Flavonoids, phenolic acids, vitamins and carotenoids are examples of natural compounds with antioxidant potential that have antagonistic effects on degenerative and inflammatory processes throughout the body, have beneficial effects on the immune and digestive systems, prevent ROS-related chronic problems and improve the overall quality of life, as shown in
