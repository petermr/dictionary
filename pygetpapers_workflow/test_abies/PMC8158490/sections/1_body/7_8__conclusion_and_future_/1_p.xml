<p>In this review, we have discussed the traditional and pharmacological uses of various conifers’ extracts against diabetes, neurological disorders, inflammation, and cancer. The phytochemical constituents present in conifer extracts are nontoxic at therapeutic levels, with polyphenolic compounds having significant biological activities. Stilbenes, terpenes, alkaloids, lignins and flavanoids, such as quercetin, rutin, resveratrol, and the compounds PYC and enzogenol, are the phytochemical components of conifer extracts reported to have sedative, antidiabetic, anticancer and anesthetic effects. In addition, phytochemicals present in conifer extracts assist in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin secretion, stimulating β cells, the NF-kB signaling pathway, the inhibition of gluconeogenic enzymes, ROS protective action as well as targeting and modulating cytokines which affect neuron cells and reduce oxidative stress. In this way, conifers’ phytochemicals are used as an alternative to synthetic drugs and can be to a greater extent in the future, as they can be helpful in the formulation of new drugs. Without a doubt, conifers’ phytochemicals are the natural sources of future drugs; in the field of drug discovery, a large number studies into phytochemicals are still required. More efforts are needed to investigate and assess the clinical potential and molecular characterization of medicinal compounds with the help of databases and interdisciplinary group efforts.</p>
