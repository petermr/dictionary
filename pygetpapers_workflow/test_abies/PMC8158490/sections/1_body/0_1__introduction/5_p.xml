<p>From the chemotaxonomic point of view, it is necessary to highlight how difficult it is to study the chemistry of conifers due to the lack of easily usable markers [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In fact, resin and phenolic compounds, including tannins, have proved, due to their complicated composition and wide variability, difficult to study and not suitable for deducing clear considerations from them. First of all, we must not forget the unsuccessful attempts, the once well-developed branches that are now essentially exhausted, of which 
 <italic>Ginkgo</italic> is a sensational example, to which we can add the genus 
 <italic>Taxus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. It is no coincidence that these species are now a source of drugs of great therapeutic importance. It is therefore possible that there is still a lot to investigate and study on the chemistry of conifers. A starting point is represented by the collection of the current scientific knowledge recorded so far and the possible use of these data in the light of the most recent interpretations and possible therapeutically interesting utilizations. In this sense, the main focus of this review is to emphasize conifers' phytochemical compounds with a broad range of applications and as a source of molecules for drug development.
