<p>Clinical trials using extracts from conifer species in humans are limited. Only a few studies have reported the use of conifer spp. extracts in humans for inflammation and cardiovascular issues. A randomized 10-day, double-blind clinical trial was conducted on traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. A pycnogenol supplement (OLIGOPIN) was orally administered with an oral dose of 150 mg per day, conducted in 60 people, with 30 control (Placebo) and 30 taking the PYC supplement, and it was found that PYC is effective in reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in TBI patients by increasing the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and C-reactive protein (CRP) [

 <sup>®</sup> at an oral dose of 480 mg/day in 26 healthy people aged between 55 and 75 years. Some significant results have been published, such as beneficial changes in anthropometric data, a reduction in unnecessary body fat, vascular and plasma rheological indices, with a reduction in blood pressure and cardiovascular-related problems [
