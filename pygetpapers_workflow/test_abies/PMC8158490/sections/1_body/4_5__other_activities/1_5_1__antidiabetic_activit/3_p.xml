<p>In vitro experiments exhibited that the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>P. halepensis</italic> bark had a greater inhibitory effect on the enzymes involved in diabetes (α-amylase and α-glucosidase) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 234.26 and 7.97 µg/mL, respectively [

Piceatannol, a resveratrol analogue, restores palmitic acid-induced disruption of insulin signaling and endothelial NO production in human endothelial cells by activating anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms (HO-1) [

(2013), the antihyperglycemic property of resveratrol appears by increasing the glucose transporter activity that occurs in the plasma membrane; the results indicate that the key antihyperglycemic action effects of resveratrol are due to the SIRT1 activation and AMPK (5' AMP-activated protein kinase) [

The multi-target effects of RV against diabetes were well-defined by Bagul and Banerjee, 2015, who underlined an improvement in insulin sensitivity and GLUT-4 translocation, while oxidative stress was reduced, carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes were regulated, SIRT1 and AMPK were activated, and adipogenic genes were decreased [
