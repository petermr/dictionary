<p>It is widely acknowledged that a variety of environmental conditions, such as soil chemistry, climate, or host plant identity (

 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Větrovský et al., 2019</xref>), can affect the composition of tree root-associated fungal communities. Forest microhabitats represent a natural source of such environmental variability in mature forest stands. Several studies documented that different tree root fungal communities are associated with different forest microhabitats (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">DeLong et al., 1997</xref>) that may significantly affect germination and regeneration of tree seedlings (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Veblen, 1989</xref>) as well as fungal communities associated with the roots of those trees that proliferate on CWD. Ericoid dwarf shrubs represent another factor that may affect the composition of fungal communities on tree roots (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kohout et al., 2011</xref>). Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi may act as endophytes in neighboring tree roots (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Vohník et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Sietiö et al., 2018</xref>). Due to the capability of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi to degrade recalcitrant compounds of plant cell walls (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Vohník et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Martino et al., 2018</xref>), decomposition of tree roots in ericoid shrubs can also differ from other forest microhabitats.
