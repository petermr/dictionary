<p>All frozen root samples were disrupted in the tissue lyzer. Subsequently, DNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin PlantII Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions and eluted in 100 μl double distilled water (ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O). The fungal internal transcribed spacer 2 of the rDNA (ITS2) was amplified in triplicate to reduce PCR bias using fungal specific combination of primers fITS7 (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Ihrmark et al., 2012</xref>) and ITS4 (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">White et al., 1990</xref>). Both primers were tagged with 10-base molecular identifiers (MID). Approximately 5 μl of DNA extract was used as template in PCR. The PCRs were conducted with Taq Pfu DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific) with final concentrations of 1x Pfu buffer, 2 mM MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>, 200 μM of each dNTP, and 0.5 μm of each primer in a total volume of 20 or 25 μl. The PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 50 cycles with 95°C for 1 min, 61°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 2 min, concluded by a final elongation at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were visualized on a 1% agarose gel. Successfully amplified samples were loaded on a 1% agarose gel and bands of the expected size were cut from the gel and processed with the Zymoclean Gel DNA recovery kit (Zymoclean). The DNA concentration in the eluates was measured using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer with the HS kit and products were equimolarly pooled. Negative control with ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O instead of template DNA was produced with a specific identifier in the same way as the experimental samples and sequenced together with them. Genomic DNA of PhiX virus was used as a positive control for the Illumina MiSeq run. Sequencing was performed using 250-bp paired-end chemistry on an Illumina MiSeq system. The obtained data were deposited in NCBI SRA (PRJNA634919).
