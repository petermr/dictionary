<p>Prior to subsequent analyses of fungal community composition, the number of sequences per sample was subsampled to median number of sequences per sample. Subsampling to the median rather than the minimum number appeared to improve beta diversity analysis since it retains higher resolution where possible (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">de Cárcer et al., 2011</xref>). Lowest number of sequences per sample was 4,959 in our study. Then, fungal OTU abundances were standardized using Hellinger transformation. Bray–Curtis dissimilarity was used to construct a fungal community dissimilarity matrix. To address the relative importance of microhabitat type and sampling time (time after seedling decapitation) and microhabitat × sampling time interaction on structure of the fungal communities and relative abundance of fungal ecophysiological categories associated with spruce seedling roots, we used a PERMANOVA as implemented in the adonis routine of the Vegan package of R (

 <italic>Post hoc</italic> test represented by pairwise PERMANOVA with 99,999 permutations was performed for fungal communities and fungal ecophysiological categories between sampling timepoints and between microhabitats to test the equality of group means (for sampling timepoints: 2, 4, 10, and 15 months and for microhabitats: forest bare soil, ericoid shrubs, and coarse woody debris). Bonferroni correction was used to calculate the corrected 
 <italic>P</italic>-value determined by the pairwise PERMANOVA analysis. Indicator fungal OTUs for different microhabitat types and sampling times were determined using "indVal” function of the labdsv package of R (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Roberts, 2015</xref>), where the significance of indicator values is determined based on a permutation test (only OTUs found in more than four samples were included in the analysis).
