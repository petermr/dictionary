<p>To determine changes in fungal communities associated with decomposition processes of spruce roots in different forest microhabitats, we decided to study decomposing roots without disconnecting the root–soil interface. We believe that this practice will help us to determine naturally developing fungal communities associated with decomposing roots in the natural context, avoiding soil disturbance, and introduction of allochthonous material that would be required if root litter bags are used. In June 2015, more than 50 healthy-looking spruce seedlings of approximately same age (4–6 years old) were selected, in spatially random design, from (i) bare forest soil, (ii) soil covered by the ericoid shrubs of 
 <italic>Vaccinium myrtillus</italic>, and (iii) CWD, approximately 150 seedlings in total. The seedlings were decapitated, i.e., cut off few centimeters aboveground, so that the remaining stem part remained visible and clearly marked. Roots of these decapitated spruce seedlings were subsequently sampled at four sampling times (2, 4, 10, and 15 months after the decapitation) to identify fungal communities developing on spruce roots. Besides the decapitated spruce seedlings, we also sampled "control” plants from the same microhabitats during all sampling times as well as in June 2015 during the time of experiment establishment. These control plants were selected based on the same criteria as the decapitated seedlings, also in spatially random design. Incorporation of the control plants into the study helped us to distinguish changes in fungal community composition during the spruce roots decomposition from shifts caused by tree aging and seasonal effects. At each sampling time, we collected eight decapitated and eight control spruce seedlings within each microhabitat which resulted in 48 samples per sampling time in total. Sampled seedlings were at least 5 m apart. Altogether, 216 samples were collected in this study. No samples were pooled. When sampled, decapitated and control seedlings were carefully pulled out of soil or decomposing wood. Only roots attached to spruce seedling stem were collected. Root samples were transported into lab within 3 h and stored in 5°C in plastic bags for up to 1 day until processed. Root systems were carefully washed under running tap water until no soil remained attached to them and then they were cut into 5 cm fragments. Ten fragments of fine roots (&lt;2 mm diameter) per sample (approximately 0.25 g of fresh weight) were frozen and stored at −20°C for subsequent DNA isolation. These roots contained the ectomycorrhizal roots tips as well as the basal roots without the mycorrhizal colonization. Remaining fine roots were dried at 50°C and used for analyses of cellulose and lignin concentration.
