<p>According to our analysis, it seems that EcMF differ in their ability to persist on decaying host plant roots. Interestingly, 
 <italic>Russula</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Cortinarius</italic> sp. were able to survive or even increase their relative abundance after the spruce seedlings decapitation. High relative abundance of 
 <italic>Russula</italic> spp. after substantial decline of photosynthetic compound production has already been reported after moth outbreak (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Saravesi et al., 2015</xref>) or bark beetle outbreak (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Štursová et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Treu et al., 2014</xref>). 
 <italic>Russula</italic> spp. were also among the very few EcMF able to maintain their relative abundances on decomposing roots as well as in adjacent soil for some time after forest stand clearcutting as opposed to other EcMF species, e.g., 
 <italic>Amanita</italic> spp. that disappeared very soon (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kohout et al., 2018</xref>). The ability to persist in soil or on host plant roots after termination or significant decrease of C flow from the host plants is likely not caused by slower decomposition of 
 <italic>Russula</italic>'s biomass, because its decomposition rate was comparable with numerous other tested EcMF (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Brabcová et al., 2018</xref>). We rather hypothesize that 
 <italic>Russula</italic>'s mycelial network radiating from roots of mature living spruce was potentially able to mobilize nutrients from decomposing plant biomass due to lignocellulose degrading enzymes (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Štursová et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Miyauchi et al., 2020</xref>). The ability to decompose organic matter was also ascribed to the second recalcitrant genus found in our study, 
 <italic>Cortinarius</italic> (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bödeker et al., 2014</xref>). The ability of 
 <italic>Russula</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Cortinarius</italic> spp. to persist on the decomposing roots may lead to direct competition for resources with saprotrophs and result in an overall decrease in decomposition rate (
