<p id="Par24">The problem of all markers used in the above studies is a limited representativeness; limited in terms of the genome coverage rather than the covering of species’ ranges. The numbers of marker loci typically range between 10 and 30 for allozymes and nuclear microsatellites, and with a few exceptions nothing is known about their positions in the genomes. On one hand, the advantage is that a type of markers can be chosen, which is optimal for a respective type of study (e.g, neutral markers for phylogenetic studies, maternally inherited markers to follow migration etc.). On the other hand, generalization and upscaling to a genome-wide scale is hardly possible. The same applies to Sanger sequencing of particular genes or DNA regions. In forest tree genomics, the candidate gene approach has been preferred because of a rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium in tree populations, which makes association studies difficult. The tested candidate genes are usually orthologs or functional equivalents of genes identified in model species (such as 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, tobacco, maize or 
 <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic>) as responsive to environmental stress or associated with phenotypic traits such as phenology, growth, resistance to drought, heat or diseases, etc. Prior to application in natural populations, they require validation by gene expression or environmental association studies (Neale and Kremer
