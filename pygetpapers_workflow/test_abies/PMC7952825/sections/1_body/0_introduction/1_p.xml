<p id="Par2">The heritable basis of intraspecific and interspecific variation of forest trees has been of interest far long before the first tools appeared, allowing to study it explicitly. In contrast to other wild-growing plants, the existence of genetic variation has direct economical implications in trees. At the advent of the modern forestry, associated with extensive planting of forests, seeds and plants were procured from the most easily accessible sources and transferred across species' ranges without limitation. This approach frequently led to economical disaster for forest owners in terms of huge losses on timber production and other benefits from forests. Therefore, field experiments such as common gardens have rapidly become a tool guiding the choice of seed sources and transfers of forest reproductive materials. The first field trial testing populations of various origins (provenances) of Scots pine (

International coordination of provenance research was also among the prominent motivations for establishing the International Union of Forestry Research Organizations (IUFRO) in 1892 (Seppälä

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2013</xref>). Since then, a plenty of national as well as international provenance trials and progeny tests with practically all commercially important tree species have been established in Slovakia.
