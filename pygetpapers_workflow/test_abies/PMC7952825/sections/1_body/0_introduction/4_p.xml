<p id="Par5">Due to their longevity, slow generation turnover and huge dimensions at adult age, forest trees have never been favourite models for the studies of fundamental phenomena in genetics. The overwhelming majority of the studies in forest trees used genetic tools to address the same issues as the botanists usually do: evolutionary and migration history of species, adaptation to environment, gene flow and hybridization etc. The progress in 'population genetics of forest trees' since the appearance of genetic markers has in fact been identical with progress in botany, not only in Slovakia but also elsewhere in the world.</p>
