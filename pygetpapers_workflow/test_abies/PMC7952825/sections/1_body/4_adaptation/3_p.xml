<p id="Par22">Common-garden experiments may serve as very useful objects for studying adaptation. First, in the case of trees, they typically contain materials collected across a large part of a species' range. Second, all population samples are planted in identical macrosites, i.e. a large part of environmental effects on the assessed traits is eliminated. Gömöry et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>) used the Slovak plot of a Europe-wide beech provenance experiment to identify traits under selection pressure by comparison of differentiation at quantitative traits (approximated by the coefficient of phenotypic differentiation

  <italic>ST</italic>
 </sub>) and differentiation at neutral markers (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ST</italic>
 </sub>). Local adaptation driven by diversifying selection was found for all vegetative-phenology-related traits such as budburst or leaf discoloration date (as indicated by 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ST</italic>
 </sub> &gt; 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ST</italic>
 </sub>), whereas stabilizing selection seems to operate on some physiological traits, e.g. stomatal conductance or transpiration rate (
