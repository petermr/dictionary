<p id="Par7">In the laboratory, we prepared 81 sediment sub-samples of 1 cm
 <sup>3</sup> for pollen analysis following standard protocols (Moore and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1991</xref>), but sieving at 500 µm to allow for large pollen grains, charcoal and other palynomorphs to be represented. Tablets with a known amount of 
 <italic>Lycopodium</italic> spores were added at the beginning of the treatment to estimate pollen concentrations (Stockmarr 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">1971</xref>). Pollen influxes were calculated dividing pollen concentrations by the sediment deposition time (yr cm
 <sup>−1</sup>). We identified pollen grains using determination keys and photographic atlases (for example, Moore and others 1991; Reille 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1992</xref>; Beug 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2004</xref>) and the reference collection of the 
 <italic>Institute of Plant Sciences</italic> at the University of Bern, up to a minimum terrestrial pollen sum of 400 grains, which excludes pollen from aquatic plants as well as fern spores. We did not distinguish 
 <italic>Quercus pubescens</italic>-t. (t. = type) and 
 <italic>Q. cerris</italic>-t. during pollen analysis, so we have grouped both into 'deciduous 
 <italic>Quercus</italic>'. In the pollen diagrams, we have represented pollen and spore percentages calculated with respect to the above defined terrestrial pollen sum. In the same slides used for pollen analysis, we quantified charcoal particles between 10 and 500 µm (referred to as 'microscopic charcoal' hereafter) according to Tinner and Hu (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2003</xref>) and Finsinger and Tinner (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2005</xref>). We estimated charcoal concentrations and influxes using the same approach as for pollen. Macrofossil analysis was conducted on 22 sediment sub-samples of 10 cm
 <sup>3</sup> sieved through a mesh of 200 µm. We then identified macrofossils using a stereomicroscope (10–50 ×), macrofossil atlases and identification keys (for example, Schoch and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1988</xref>; Tomlinson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">1995</xref>; Lévesque 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1998</xref>; Birks 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>), and the reference collection of the 
 <italic>Institute of Plant Sciences</italic> at the University of Bern. In the macrofossil diagrams, the results are expressed as concentrations of macrofossils per 10 cm
 <sup>3</sup> of sediment. We also counted charcoal particles (&gt; 200 µm; called 'macroscopic charcoal' hereafter) during macrofossil analyses, calculating influxes (# cm
 <sup>−2</sup> y
 <sup>−1</sup>) dividing by the volume of sediment sieved (cm
 <sup>3</sup>) and the sediment deposition time (y cm
 <sup>−1</sup>).
