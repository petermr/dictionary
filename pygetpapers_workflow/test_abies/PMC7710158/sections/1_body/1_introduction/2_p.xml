<p id="Par3">Paleoecology's long-term perspective enables to explore ecosystem dynamics under different climatic scenarios and disturbance regimes and therefore to get relevant insights into the aforementioned questions. For instance, regional paleoecological records have shown that monospecific beech forests established in relatively recent times following the decline of 
 <italic>Abies</italic> and other mesophilous deciduous trees (for example, Watson

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2010a</xref>; Branch 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>). Further, recent interdisciplinary studies combining paleoclimatic, paleoecological and dynamic modeling efforts have suggested an ecologically unexpected potential of mixed 
 <italic>Abies alba</italic> (silver fir) forests to cope with conditions significantly warmer and drier than today's (Tinner and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2013</xref>). Despite these progresses, major relevant gaps in the ecological knowledge of the Apennine forests persist, particularly the causes of past paramount vegetational shift such as the late Holocene expansion of 
 <italic>Fagus</italic> and its ecological consequences. Several hypotheses have been formulated to explain the mass expansion of beech forests, namely climate change, human impact (and the use of fire), or a combination of both (Watson

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2010a</xref>; Branch 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>). However, the lack of robust independent paleoclimatic reconstructions, the usually insecure chronologies (most of the available records are bulk dated; see Finsinger and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>), the paucity of charcoal records, and the relatively low taxonomical resolution of pollen records have so far hindered comprehensive and quantitative assessments of the responses of the main forest trees of the Apennines to past climate change and fire disturbance. Similarly, the potential occurrence of legacy effects in the current composition and structure of Apennine forests have not been fully addressed yet (but see Tinner and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2013</xref>; Branch and Marini 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>).
