<p id="Par26">In this study, we have shown that highly diverse mixed forests dominated by

 <italic>Fraxinus excelsior</italic>,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2014</xref>), so reviving these ancient Early and Mid-Holocene forests could be a feasible possibility to adapt forests to future conditions (Henne and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>). This holds particularly true when considering that 
 <italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic>, the currently dominant tree in the montane belt of the Apennines, is way more sensitive to summer drought than most of the tree species dominating during the warmest period of the Holocene (for example, 
 <italic>Abies alba, Fraxinus excelsior, Acer, Tilia, Ulmus</italic>; Pigott

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2008</xref>; Dorado-Liñán and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2019</xref>). However, future forest management must also consider that in many locations most of the natural components of the Early and Mid-Holocene mixed forests are currently rare or absent after millennia of intense land-use. Moreover, the moderate-to-high sensitivity to fire of most of these trees might be a major issue that forest management should account for, given that burning may increase in the near future under global warming conditions (Moriondo and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2006</xref>).
