<p>Before the advent of sequencing technologies, molecular microbial ecology was severely limited by low-resolution observation of microbial diversity. Nowadays, high-throughput microbiome sequencing provides insightful data on microbial occurrences and dynamics. Nevertheless, limitations still persist. The most common procedures in microbiome studies comprise direct DNA extraction from environmental samples, amplification and subsequent sequencing of marker genes along with the analysis of the resulting compositional dataset. Therefore, next to an adequate experimental design based on a robust sampling strategy, the DNA extracts analyzed largely determine the study's output. Several types of environmental DNA extracts have been differentiated in the literature as reviewed by 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Nagler et al. (2018a)</xref>. Here, we will focus on the three most common DNA types: the total DNA pool and its extracellular and intracellular DNA fractions (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Nannipieri et al., 2020</xref>). Usually, only the total DNA pool is used. It is extracted directly from the environmental samples using standard protocols based on enzymatic, physical and/or chemical cell lysis and contains both intra- and extracellular DNA. The intracellular DNA fraction is obtained from intact cells contained in the environmental sample; while the extracellular DNA fraction is composed of DNA – no longer present inside cell membranes – occurring in the extracellular environment (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Pietramellara et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Nagler et al., 2018b</xref>). In fact, extracellular environmental DNA can be defined as former intracellular DNA that has been released either actively (active DNA extrusion) or passively (after cell death and consequent cell lysis) into the environment. Methods to sequentially extract the extra- and intracellular DNA fractions of different environmental matrices or biological assemblages are available (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ascher et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Wagner et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Carini et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Nagler et al., 2018a</xref>). First, the DNA occurring in the extracellular environment is recovered by gentle washings in alkaline buffer; the remaining pellet is then processed by cell-lysis inducing steps so as to extract the intracellular DNA. Thereafter, both DNA fractions are purified to obtain DNA compatible for downstream analyses. Due to the various terms and abbreviations used for these different DNA types in the literature (reviewed by 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Nagler et al., 2018a</xref>) and to avoid any misunderstanding and misinterpretation of the results, we will not use any acronyms throughout the text.
