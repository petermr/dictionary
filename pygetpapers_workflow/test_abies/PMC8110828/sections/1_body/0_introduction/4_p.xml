<p>The relevance of extracellular DNA has long been neglected in microbial ecological research, despite it has been found at qualitatively and quantitatively relevant concentrations in a wide range of environments (

By only assessing the directly extracted total DNA pool, consisting of extra- and intracellular DNA, there is the risk of extracellular DNA masking the intracellular DNA within the community analysis. 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Carini et al. (2016)</xref> reported that up to 40% of both prokaryotic and fungal DNA in soil was attributed to extracellular DNA. This led to an inflation of microbial richness measures by up to 55% and a misestimation of relative taxon abundances, including some key taxa for the ecosystem functioning.
