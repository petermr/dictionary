<p>The total DNA pool was extracted from 0.1 g cut-milled sample using MP Biomedicals DNA Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. To assure a complete disruption of the wood tissue, one 1/400 ceramic sphere (MPI biochemical cat# 6540-424) was added to the lysing matrix. The extra- and intracellular DNA fractions were sequentially extracted by applying the procedure by
