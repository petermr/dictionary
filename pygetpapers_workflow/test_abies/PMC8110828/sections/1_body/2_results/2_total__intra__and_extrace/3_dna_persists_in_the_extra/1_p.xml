<p>Given the fact that different DCls do not occur within the same log, at least not in the very same local point, and that the entire decay process is too slow to enable the sample collection of all DCls (Iâ€“V) from one deadwood log, the persistence of extracellular DNA in the logs and the exact abundances of ASVs' intra- and extracellular DNA cannot be monitored over time. Therefore, we selected those ASVs that were detected in either DCls I and III or DCls III and V, respectively. Although we will likely miss a number of incidences for extracellular persistence using this approach, a signal in extracellular DNA persistence might be even stronger. Out of these 40 ASVs (24 + 16 = 40 ASVs, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) that were detected in DCls I and III and DCls III and V, respectively, there were 19 ASVs whose relative abundance in the intracellular DNA fraction was lower in the more progressed DCl. Five of those ASVs were not detected in the intracellular DNA fraction of the more progressed DCl while they were found in the respective extracellular DNA and except for one ASV also in the total DNA pool. In a total of 16 ASVs their relative abundance was higher in the extracellular DNA fraction compared to the intracellular DNA fraction in the more progressed DCl. By overall rank abundance, that is ASV size measured by number of reads across all samples, these ASVs were listed at positions between 10 and 234, indicating that they were not ASVs of low-abundance. Moreover, several ASVs defined as indicator ASVs by ALDEx2 were detected in the intracellular DNA fraction of the less progressed DCl, then across DNA types and remained detectable in the extracellular DNA fraction in the more progressed DCl, i.e., after the ASV representing a specific population was no longer detectable in either the intracellular fraction or the total DNA pool (
