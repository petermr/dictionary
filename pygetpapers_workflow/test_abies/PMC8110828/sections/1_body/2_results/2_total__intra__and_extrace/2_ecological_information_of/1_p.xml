<p>On a broad(er) scale (than ASV or genera), the overall taxonomic distribution within a DCl was comparable between all DNA types (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). The information about the bacteriome provided by the sequencing analysis of the intracellular DNA fraction, representing potentially living bacteria (intact cells), was similar to that depicted in the subchapter “
 <italic>P. abies</italic> deadwood bacteriomes differ among decay classes” (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). At ASV level, there were distinct differences between DNA types for the different DCls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). We observed that 
 <italic>intra</italic> and 
 <italic>in/ex</italic> ASVs were taxonomically diverse (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), and accounted for both a high number of ASVs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) and a significant percentage of reads (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).
