<p>The distribution of 
 <italic>intra</italic> and 
 <italic>in/ex</italic> ASVs annotated as 
 <italic>Acidobacteriota</italic> followed a different pattern than that shown in the subchapter "
 <italic>P. abies</italic> deadwood bacteriomes differ among decay classes‚Äù. In DCl I, a higher number of these ASVs were affiliated to 
 <italic>Acidobacteriota</italic> compared to 
 <italic>Actinobacteriota</italic> and these ASVs were also higher in relative abundance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Several of them were consistently detected across DCls and also often across DNA types (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). In DCls III and V, the 
 <italic>intra</italic> and 
 <italic>in/ex</italic> ASVs annotated as 
 <italic>Acidobacteriota</italic> and 
 <italic>Actinobacteriota</italic> had comparable numbers of ASVs and read proportions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Underlining the high abundance and diversity of 
 <italic>Acidobacteriota</italic> in DCl III, this taxon was higher in relative abundance in the total DNA pool compared to both the intra- and extracellular DNA fractions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ST2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The same observation was made for 
 <italic>Planctomycetota</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ST2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), pointing toward an increased relevance of this taxonomic group in the intermediate stages of 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> deadwood decay.
