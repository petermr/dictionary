<p>In DCls I and III, several ASVs annotated as 
 <italic>Verrucomicrobiota</italic> were detected only in the intracellular DNA fraction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast to what has been reported in subchapter "
 <italic>P. abies</italic> deadwood bacteriomes differ among decay classes‚Äù, the majority of these ASVs were affiliated to 
 <italic>Chtoniobacteraceae</italic> (6/8 ASVs). 
 <italic>Verrucomicrobiota</italic> ASVs that remained undetected in the total DNA pool were usually present only in either the intra- or extracellular DNA fraction. Only in DCl V,
