<p>Despite their low proportions, 
 <italic>Planctomycetota</italic>, mainly WD2101 soil group, were increasingly detected from DCl I to V (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Several members of this taxon are known for degrading complex polymers, including cellulose (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting their potential role in deadwood degradation, which still remains underexplored (

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Probst et al., 2018</xref>). 
 <italic>Planctomycetota</italic> have unique cell-wall and outer membrane structures as well as the ability to form biofilms and extracellular polysaccharides. Extracellular DNA has been shown to stabilize biofilms, to contribute to cell-cell-interaction within microbial populations and to serve as nutrient source (as reviewed by 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Pietramellara et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, extracellular DNA has been shown to increase 
 <italic>Planctomycetota</italic> (WD2101) in soil (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Morrissey et al., 2015</xref>). We hypothesize that the high concentration of extracellular DNA (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and the deadwood's environmental approximation to soil with increasing decay might have benefited 
 <italic>Planctomycetota</italic> abundance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>) and might also contribute to the higher read proportions of 
 <italic>Planctomycetota</italic> in DCl V compared to the other DCls and the higher numbers of unique 
 <italic>extra</italic> ASVs observed in this DCl (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>).
