 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). We report the complete genome sequence of 
 <italic>Paenibacillus</italic> sp. strain 37, previously isolated from the rhizosphere of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Abies nordmanniana</named-content> (Nordmann fir) seedlings sampled at Baumschule Engler, Hohenlockstedt, Germany (53°58′30.5″N, 9°37′51.9″E) (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). A single colony of strain 37 was inoculated in lysogeny broth (LB) overnight at 28°C, and genomic DNA (gDNA) was purified using the NucleoSpin kit (Macherey-Nagel, DE) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
