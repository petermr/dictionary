<p>Sequencing was performed using the BGISEQ-500 and PacBio Sequel systems at BGI Hong Kong. For BGISEQ-500 sequencing, 1 μg genomic DNA was randomly fragmented on a Covaris instrument (Brighton, UK). DNA fragments between 200 and 400 bp were selected by Agencourt AMPure XP medium kit. The size-selected DNA fragments were end repaired and 3′ adenylated. Adaptors were ligated to the 3′-adenylated fragment ends. The DNA fragments, now including adaptors, were amplified and purified, and the double-stranded PCR products were heat denatured and circularized by the splint oligonucleotide sequence. The resulting circular DNA library was sequenced on the BGISEQ-500 sequencing platform according to the manufacturer's protocol (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Adapter sequences and low-quality bases (&lt;Q20) were trimmed from the raw reads using SOAPnuke v1.5.5 software at BGI Hong Kong. PacBio sequencing used 8 μg gDNA fragmented to 10 kb with Covaris g-TUBEs. The DNA fragments were repaired to obtain blunt ends, ligated, and treated with ExoIII and ExoVII to remove linear fragments after pooling, and BluePippin was used for size selection prior to SMRTbell sequencing, followed by the removal of adapter sequences according to the PacBio Sequel system protocol at BGI Hong Kong.
