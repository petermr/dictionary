<p>Pectins are heterogeneous polysaccharides that are present in the primary cell walls and middle lamellae of all plants [
 <xref rid="B10-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Pectins are composed of at least 17 different monosaccharides, with 
 <sc>d</sc>-galacturonic acid (GalA) as the most abundant followed by 
 <sc>d</sc>-galactose (Gal), 
 <sc>l</sc>-arabinose (Ara) and 
 <sc>l-</sc>rhamnose (Rha) [

 <xref rid="B12-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, their structure is believed to follow a general model based on four structurally distinct domains, including homogalacturonan (HG), a linear polymer of α-1,4 linked GalA, rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) and rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) and some xylogalacturonan (XGA) chains [
 <xref rid="B13-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. RG-I is composed of a polymeric backbone of alternating Rha and GalA units with neutral side chains of Ara and Gal (arabinans and arabinogalactans). The RG-II domain consists of a well-conserved HG backbone branched with complex side chains containing eleven different monosaccharides, including some minor sugars as 2-O-methylxylose, 2-O-methylfucose, apiose, aceric acid, 2-keto-3-deoxy-
 <sc>d</sc>-manno-octulosonic acid, and 3-deoxy-
 <sc>d</sc>-lyxo-2-heptulosaric acid [

 <xref rid="B15-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These domains are considered to be covalently linked and form a complex pectic network [

 <xref rid="B17-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The branched regions (RG-I, RG-II, XGA) are referred to as the "hairy regions” and the linear HG as the "smooth region”. The properties of pectin make it a popular material to be used in the food industry as emulsifier, thickener, gelling agent, and stabilizer [

 <xref rid="B20-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Pectins also show potential immunostimulant properties and have possible applications in wound dressing, tissue engineering and drug delivery [
