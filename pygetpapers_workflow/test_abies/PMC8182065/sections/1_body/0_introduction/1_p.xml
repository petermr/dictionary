<p>Plant resistance to biotic threats is mediated through defensive traits that are present at all times (constitutive defense), but also through those triggered once damage or infection is perceived (induced defense). Constitutive defenses provide a first line of protection that can deter or stop attackers, while induced defenses strengthen these effects making plants unsuitable hosts and decrease the likelihood of further attack (

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Agrawal, 1999</xref>). In conifers, quantitative and qualitative changes to constitutive conditions are rapidly initiated upon mechanical wounding, insect feeding and fungal infection. Interestingly, defenses can even be mobilized earlier and prior to damage, as for example recently shown for the effects of insect egg deposition on 
 <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bittner et al., 2019</xref>). These responses include secondary resin production and traumatic resin duct formation, synthesis of new phenolics, lignification of fibers, and initiation of wound periderm (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Franceschi et al., 2005</xref>). The difference between the constitutive and induced state is referred to as "inducibility,‚Äù and represents a key functional trait of defensive investment and effective resistance to specific enemies (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cipollini and Heil, 2010</xref>). Indeed, the essential contribution of induced responses to effective conifer resistance has been demonstrated for bark-beetle-fungi complexes (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Krokene, 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Raffa et al., 2017</xref>), infection by fungal pathogens (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Danielsson et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Ganthaler et al., 2017</xref>) as well as weevil pests (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Zas et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Whitehill et al., 2019</xref>). Host colonization by many of these attackers impairs water and nutrient transport, and result in tree death if induced responses fail to hamper damage levels (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Kolosova and Bohlmann, 2012</xref>). Thus, understanding the extent of inducibility is essential for improving tree survival, for example within forest protection, and to reveal ecologically-relevant tree properties that mediate interactions.
