<p>For plants that were inoculated with 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic> instead of an uninfected agar plug, we observed similar effects of MeJA treatment, yet more variation in responses among clones (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Also, qualitative changes in terpene chemistry occurred (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Compounds such as (+)-3-carene and geranyllinalool varied more strongly among clones (across the first axis of variation) when MeJA treatment and fungal infection co-occurred. This is consistent with previous studies which have found that (+)-3-carene is often induced following fungal infection (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Croteau et al., 1987</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">FÃ¤ldt et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>), and that both compounds appear to play a role in differential susceptibility of Norway spruce to 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic> and 
 <italic>Heterobasidion parviporum</italic> infection (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Danielsson et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Axelsson et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, (+)-3-carene has also been associated with conifer resistance against insects. For example, it is important for Sitka spruce (
 <italic>Picea sitchensis</italic>) resistance against the white pine weevil (
 <italic>Pissodes strobi</italic>; 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Robert et al., 2010</xref>), in 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> against the pine sawfly 
 <italic>Diprion pini</italic> (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Pasquier-Barre et al., 2001</xref>), and in lodgepole pine (
 <italic>Pinus contorta</italic>) against the Douglas-fir pitch moth (
 <italic>Synanthedon novaroensis</italic>; 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Rocchini et al., 2000</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Lundborg et al. (2016b)</xref> also found that (+)-3-carene appears to be a feeding deterrent to the pine weevil (
 <italic>H. abietis</italic>), however, it seems to be induced by MeJA to a lesser extent in 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> compared to 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Lundborg et al., 2016a</xref>). Overall, the changes we observed in terpene chemistry are consistent with ours and others' previous work, and corroborate that MeJA induces changes in defensive chemistry that likely influence Norway spruce resistance to insect damage and fungal infection.
