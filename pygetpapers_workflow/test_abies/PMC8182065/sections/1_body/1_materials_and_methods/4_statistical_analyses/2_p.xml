<p>To examine any potential trade-offs between resistance to insect and fungal damage, we conducted Pearson's product-moment correlations using the 
 <italic>cor.test</italic> function in R (The R stats package, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">R Core Team, 2020</xref>). To examine the correlation between constitutive resistances, we correlated estimated means for each clone (from the models described above) for area debarked and lesion length in the control group (0 mM MeJA). To examine the correlation in MeJA-induced resistance, we correlated the coefficients of the change between 0 and 50 mM (i.e., slope of the reaction norms) for each clone, from the models described above for area debarked and lesion length. Using these estimates, we also conducted Pearson's product-moment correlations between terpene compounds and insect damage or fungal infection. Mean estimates of area debarked or lesion length were correlated to the average absolute terpene amounts of each compound (or the sum of all terpenes) per clone, both under the constitutive and induced state and (0 and 50 mM MeJA respectively) but without fungal inoculation. These bivariate correlations were conducted separately for each terpene compound and area debarked or lesion length.
