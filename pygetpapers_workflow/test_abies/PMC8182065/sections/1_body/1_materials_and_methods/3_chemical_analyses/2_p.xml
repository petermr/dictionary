<p>Stem pieces were taken from the freezer after 5 months, and two phloem samples were removed from stems using a surgical knife. To examine the chemical effects of the MeJA treatment 
 <italic>per se</italic> (non-fungus inoculated MeJA treated vs. untreated plants), phloem was collected from a "control zone” located 5 cm below and on the opposite side of the stem from the "reaction zone” (inoculation area). Further, to also be able to analyze the induced defense caused by fungus inoculation, phloem was collected from directly below the inoculation area. This method of comparing tissue from the "inoculation area” and a "control area” from the opposite side of the stem, is usually used in older trees with thicker trunks (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Axelsson et al., 2020</xref>). Since we used thinner trees in our experiment, we cannot be completely sure that fungal infection does not affect the opposite side of the stem bark. Samples of approx. 1.5 cm
 <sup>2</sup> in size were chopped into smaller pieces (following standard protocol as described in 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Persson et al., 1993</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Axelsson et al., 2020</xref>), and each was immediately placed (using tweezers) in a 2-ml glass vial with solvent. Phloem samples were extracted in 0.5 mL n-hexane (VWR, Ref no. 601-037-00-0) containing 0.05 mg mL
 <sup>–1</sup> of internal standard (pentadecane; Lancaster synthesis, Alfa Aesar). Extraction time was 48 h, and after this time, extracts were transferred to new 2-ml glass vials. These were stored at −30°C until analysis using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was conducted. The dry weight of the extracted phloem pieces was measured after 5 h at 80°C.
