<p>The terpene chemistry of plants in the blue-stain fungus experiment (
 <italic>E. polonica-</italic>inoculated and control group) which had received 0 and 50 mM MeJA treatment, was quantified to investigate the effect of MeJA on plants' terpene production. Note that for clone 1, plants in the 50 mM were never included in the experiment, so for this clone plants in the 25 mM MeJA treatment were used instead. No plants in the insect enclosure experiment were harvested for chemical analyses.
