<p>We conducted the same analyses as described above also for plants that had received inoculation with 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic>. Treatment with MeJA had a signficant effect on the total concentration of terpenes (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), and it influenced the clones’ positions along the axes of variation differently than when plants were not inoculated with the fungus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Both increases and decreases along PC1 and PC2 were observed depending on the clone. Similar to those not inoculated with the fungus, compounds like (−)-α-pinene, (−)-β-pinene and myrcene increased following MeJA, but changes in compounds such as geranyllinalool and (+)-3-carene were more important for plants responses to the fungus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Again, differences among clones explained most of the variation in terpene chemistry (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Unlike the effects observed when MeJA occurred alone (without fungal inoculation, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), fungal infection caused qualitative changes in terpene chemistry as indicated by changes in the relative amounts of terpenes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). These relative changes varied per treatment and clone (MeJA × clone interaction, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).
