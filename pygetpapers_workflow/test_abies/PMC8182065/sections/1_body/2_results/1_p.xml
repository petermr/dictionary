<p>We found that MeJA treatment decreased the extent of pine weevil damage and blue-stain fungus infection on Norway spruce clones, which were separately exposed to these two pests. Plants treated with 25 or 50 mM MeJA showed significantly lower levels of insect damage and shorter lesion lengths relative to control plants (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). However, clones responded similarly to 25 and 50 mM MeJA, with no significant differences among these treatments for insect or fungal damage (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Given this lack of difference and that samples for terpene chemistry were only taken from Norway spruce clones receiving 0 and 50 mM MeJA, we present results based on models that included only these two levels of MeJA. Note that for Norway spruce clone number 1, plants in the 50 mM MeJA group were never planted in the field experiment due to needle browning (see section "Materials and Methods‚Äù), so results for the 25 mM MeJA treatment are presented instead.
