<p>We also found that insect damage and fungal infection exhibited a negative relationship to each other, when estimates for each clone were compared. For plants that were not induced (0 mM MeJA), mean estimates of area debarked and lesion length for each clone negatively correlated with each other (

 <italic>t</italic> = −2.7, DF = 7, and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.033). Likewise, we found a negative correlation between the effect of MeJA treatment on lesion length and area debarked (

 <italic>t</italic> = −2.6, DF = 7, and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.037). In other words, we found a negative relationship between the estimates of the change in area debarked and lesion length that occured from the 0 to the 50 mM MeJA treatment (reaction norms observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Norway spruce clones showing the largest reduction in area debarked following MeJA treatment, showed a smaller reduction in lesion length and viceversa. We also found a few negative bivariate correlations between mean area debarked per clone and each teperne compound, but only when plants had been treated with 50 mM MeJA (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). Moreover, mean estimates of lesion lengths per clone positively correlated with some terpene compounds, but only in the constitutive state (0 mM MeJA) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). In line with other studies, we found that MeJA negatively affected plant growth in terms of apical shoot length, total plant height and stem diameter (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). On average, the the apical (top) shoot length decreased with 22%, the total plant height with 3%, and the stem diameter with 2% when plants were MeJA-treated relative to controls.
