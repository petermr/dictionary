  <p>Reaction norms depicting the change in 
   <bold>(A)</bold> area debarked (mm
   <sup>2</sup>) by pine weevils (
   <italic>H. abietis</italic>) and 
   <bold>(B)</bold> lesion lengths (mm) inflicted by the blue-stain fungus (
   <italic>E. polonica</italic>) on Norway spruce (
   <italic>P. abies</italic>) clones (1–9) treated with 0 or 50 mM methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Estimated means (from models presented in 
   <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) for each clone are shown. For clone 1, plants in the 50 mM were not included in the experiment (see section “Materials and Methods”), so results for the 25 mM MeJA treatment are presented instead. The order in which each clone’s reaction norm appears in the graph is reflected in the clone number legend for each panel. Estimates ± standard error for area debarked and lesion length, per clone and treatment combination, can be found in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>.
