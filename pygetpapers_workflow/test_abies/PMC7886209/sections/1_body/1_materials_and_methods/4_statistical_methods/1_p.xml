<p>In this study correlations are used as effect sizes to explain heterogeneity of factors reported in literature, that are associated with tree failure for each species mentioned. Fisher’s z-transformation was applied to convert Pearson’s or Spearman’s correlation coefficients to obtain an approximately normally distributed value [

 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. We used t-tests to compare correlations between broadleaf and coniferous trees for each factor associated with tree failure. These t-tests between deciduous and coniferous trees resulted with and without transformed correlation coefficients in significant differences for the majority of factors. Therefore, the transformed effect sizes are used to calculate a mean transformed correlation weighted by the within-study variance based on the sample size [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], for deciduous and coniferous trees separately. A random-effects model with weighting of the different effect sizes was used. A separate analysis was performed for all effect sizes estimated for a specific factor. The averaged z values are used to test heterogeneity between the different samples examining whether all effect sizes are evaluating the same effect. Cochran’s Q-statistic is calculated to indicate the variance of the weighted squared deviations [

 <sup>2</sup>-statistic and among-study variance τ
 <sup>2</sup>, to assess a proportion of the variance in effect sizes [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Heterogeneity was estimated in case two or more effect sizes for one factor and failure type were reported in literature [
