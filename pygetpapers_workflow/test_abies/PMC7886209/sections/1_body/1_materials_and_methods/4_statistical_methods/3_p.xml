<p>Fisher's combined probability test was used to determine a probable degree of heterogeneity under the assumption that a factor does not relate to tree failure [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The execution of the literature search revealed that many studies instead of an exact p-value just reported significance (&lt; 0.05) or insignificance (&gt; 0.05). Another consideration is that an insignificant effect does not cause the absence of an effect always to be most likely [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Therefore, all p-values (negative, positive, significant and not-significant) were included even when described as a disparity. In addition a Bayesian approach has been taken, since Bayesian factors provide a reliable alternative to problems of p-values. From the transformed r-value from each study for each factor a one-sample t-test has been conducted [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], in order to obtain a Bayes Factor for estimating the null effect. The Bayes Factors indicate the probability that the selected factors appear to have an effect on failure (H1) relative to having no effect at all (H0). The Bayes Factor has been calculated with JASP version 0.10.2 [
