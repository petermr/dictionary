<p>The potential for tree or branch failure finds its origin in biological causes (fungi, decay, vigor), climatological conditions (wind, drought), mechanical (cracks, weak branch unions, leaning trees) and structural defects (branches with a sharp angle, lopsided branches) or site specific conditions [

 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Therefore, it is expected that studies on tree failure are published in a broad range of scientific journals. To provide an overview of factors that influence urban tree failure a systematic review has been performed on articles published until July 25
 <sup>th</sup> 2019. Systematic reviews are widely applied in social and medical sciences [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This systematic review has been conducted according to the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The literature search in scholarly databases was executed by using the keywords 'tree AND failure', 'tree AND stability, 'tree AND hazard', 'branch AND failure', 'branch AND hazard', 'root AND failure', 'root AND stability' and 'root AND hazard'. Searches were rerun using additional search terms identified from keywords of studies that were considered relevant to this review (urban in combination with all previous keywords; stem AND failure; street trees AND failure). Databases include Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, Wiley Online Library, JSTOR, SpringerLink, Taylor &amp; Francis and Google Scholar. Peer reviewed articles were selected and screened on the availability of full text.
