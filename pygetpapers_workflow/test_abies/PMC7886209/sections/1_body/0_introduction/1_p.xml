<p>In North-America, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Europe more than 70% of the people reside in urbanised regions [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In these urbanised regions trees increase liveability by adding climatological, financial, environmental, ornamental and social advantages. Trees contribute to the physical and mental health of citizens in many ways [

 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Environmental advantages include the capturing of airborne particulate matter and greenhouse gases, provision of habitats for urban fauna and flora and a reduction of rainwater runoff [

 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Urban trees influence the climate by mitigating urban heat island effects [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Besides environmental advantages, urban trees also provide positive externalities like financial benefits. Hedonic pricing methods indicate an increase in real estate property value due to urban trees [

 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The presence of urban trees affects multiple physical health benefits and reduces the stress levels for residents and patients [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Despite the efforts of policymakers in expressing these benefits, sometimes people in urban regions express a negative view on urban trees [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These are often rooted in issues of tree failure, which occasionally cause personal (injuries or death) or property damage [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, policy makers and community managers have laid down the management of urban trees in tree risk management programs. In Europe and North-America many laws and regulations prescribe the liability for having such programs [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These programs also deal with the assessment of tree risks, which are usually expressed to deal with 'hazard or hazardous' trees. A tree is hazardous when structural defects exist which can cause tree or branch failure and where this failure can cause personal or property damage [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Failure arises when the tree or branch is unable to compensate the (lack of) forces the tree is exposed to, in the urban environment. In this study failure occurs when the systemic functioning fails, which includes overturning trees (maximum/critical overturning moment) apart from breaking stems and branches.
