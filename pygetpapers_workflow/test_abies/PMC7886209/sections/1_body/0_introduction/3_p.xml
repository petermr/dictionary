<p>Since the ‘90s tree risk assessment methods to assess biomechanics, visual anomalies and the condition of trees have been developed [

 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. There has been an increasing number of studies focussing on the applied procedures and technological devices to support these assessments. This increased simultaneously the number of variables and measured parameters and the variability of tree risk assessments. At the same time corresponding costs of urban tree inventory systems held by tree owners increased. Differences in tree risk assessments are also influenced by the individual evaluation of tree risk assessors. Field experts, i.e. arborists, who execute tree risk assessments use criteria and indicators combined with personal experience to identify and evaluate the hazardousness of urban trees [

 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The execution of tree risk assessments often also involves a qualitative approach, the visual assessments (VTA), since biomechanical characteristics of trees cannot always be measured accurately from ground level (roots, branches) or only at high costs. Therefore, recent studies emphasize the importance of decreasing the number of variables [

 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Each study proposes a selection of variables promoted for tree risk assessments largely based on selections made by tree risk assessors (arborists, academics, policy makers).
