<p>The number of studies and reported effect sizes on other factors than the ones mentioned in 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> are both small, making the effect of a publication bias relatively large. However, a visual examination of the funnel plots for factors with enough reported effect sizes did not indicate asymmetry in the reported effects (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246805.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Also, Eggers’ regression test provides a statistically non-significant estimate, suggesting absence of publication bias.
