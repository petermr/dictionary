<p>All weighted mean correlation coefficients (see Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>) were significantly different from zero after applying Fishers' combined probability test (see Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.t005" ref-type="table">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.t006" ref-type="table">6</xref>). The Bayes Factors indicate the probability that these factors appear to have an effect on the failure types (stem/root) (H1) relative to having no effect at all (H0). Height and Stem weight of coniferous trees show an overwhelming preference for a very strong occurrence with stem failure. The factors Age (coniferous), Diameter Breast Height (DBH) (deciduous), DBH
 <sup>2</sup> (deciduous), DBH
 <sup>2</sup>H (coniferous and deciduous), DBH
 <sup>3</sup> (coniferous and deciduous), Height (deciduous), Stem volume (coniferous) and Tree weight (coniferous) indicate a strong evidence in favour of an occurrence with stem failure. The remaining factors appear to have a minor preference for an effect. With regard to root failure only the factors Stem mass and Tree mass show strong evidence in favour of an effect.
