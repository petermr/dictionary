<p>The statistics on factors associated with root failure in 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> are presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. The p-values indicating a significance for Cochrane’s Q differ in case of root failure significantly for DBH
 <sup>2</sup>H of coniferous trees, Stem mass and Tree mass. This suggests the presence of heterogeneity, meaning that the correlations between these factors and root failure among studies differ from each other for the different species. 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> shows that the non-significant values for all other factors appear in cases of a small number of effect sizes, in other words that there is not enough statistical power to detect a variability which can explain heterogeneity. The reported effect sizes for two factors come from deciduous trees: DBH deciduous and DBH
 <sup>2</sup>H deciduous. The other factors originate from coniferous trees.
