<p>The statistics on the factors associated with stem failure in 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> are presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The p-values indicating a significance for Cochrane’s Q differ in case of stem failure significantly for Diameter Breast Height (DBH) of coniferous trees and the related factors cubed Diameter Breast Height (DBH
 <sup>3</sup>) and squared Diameter Breast Height times Height (DBH
 <sup>2</sup>H) both of coniferous trees, Height of deciduous trees, Stem volume, Tree weight and Stem weight. The significance suggests the presence of heterogeneity especially with the larger sample sizes. Meaning that the correlations between these factors and stem failure among studies differ from each other for the different species. 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows that the non-significant values appear in cases of a small number of effect sizes for the factors Age, Crown area, Crown width and Wind speed canopy-top. In other words there is not enough statistical power to detect a variability that can explain heterogeneity. For the factor Height a non-significant Q statistic is shown with a corresponding relatively high number of effect sizes (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), appearing that there is absence of heterogeneity. Only the effect sizes related to crown width, were reported for deciduous trees. The reported effect sizes for all other factors come from coniferous trees.
