<p>After the completion of the practice stage, the participants were asked: "On a scale of 1 (not at all) to 10 (all the time), how well were you able to follow the instructions on how to focus your attention?‚Äù After the participant marked down the answer to this question, the software automatically started a 3-min rest. Following this short rest, all the participants performed a post-test that consisted of 20 trials from each of the tasks in a counterbalanced order. No attentional focus instructions were provided prior to or during the post-test. The purpose of the post-test was to examine whether the attentional focus instructions given during practice had any effect on performance when they were no longer provided. After the post-test was completed, the participants were asked again about their ability to follow the attentional instructions.</p>
