<p>Regardless of the effects of the different types of attentional foci on performance, all the above-mentioned tasks share a common denominator – they are all relatively complex tasks that either require accuracy and/or are performed by using several degrees of freedom. The question we ask, then, is: Do focus of attention instructions affect simple tasks, such as reaction time (RT) tasks, as well? The effects of different attentional foci (e.g., sensory vs. motor) on RT were examined several decades ago (e.g.,

 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Henry (1960)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Christina (1973)</xref>, for example, showed that attention toward the movement to be made (similar to internal focus of attention) led to longer RTs compared with attention toward the stimulus to respond to (e.g., sensory attention – different from the current definition of external focus that relates to the movement’s effect or to the object manipulated by the movement).
