<p>The patient presented to the emergency room on postoperative day 2 with severe abdominal pain and no flatulence or defecation for 2 days. Abdominal computed tomography showed mild small intestinal dilation and the "whirlpool sign,” consistent with intestinal volvulus (

The small intestinal membrane was found to be stuck in the lower right quadrant by the reverse hook of the V-loc™ suture that had previously been used to close the peritoneum, and the surrounding intestines exhibited significant congestive edema (

The patient recovered well and was discharged on postoperative day 2. Upon hospital discharge, physical examination revealed no abdominal softness or pressure pain, and he was able to tolerate food and perform bowel movements.
