<p>We hypothesized that learning more about the ethical problems referred to CESS by mental health professionals in the form of a typology provides a way of gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying needs and expectations. We adopted a narrow approach to defining “ethical problems” to ground this typology theoretically. According to this, an ethical problem can be determined by two propositions: Firstly, ethical problems are based on a relationship between a bearer of moral rights and an addressee of a claim. Secondly, in terms of content, ethical problems can be characterized by uncertainty regarding an ethically acceptable course of action or inability to carry out an accepted course. This can, for example, be the case when basic principles are in conflict or it is unclear which moral principle to apply (

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).
