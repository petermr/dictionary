<p>Yasmin Aghajan reported a case in which a novel EWSR1-ATF1 gene fusion was revealed using next-generation sequencing analysis, but FLI-1 immunohistochemical results were negative, suggesting that NGS has the advantage of showing the CCS EWSR1-ATF1 fusion (

Compared with traditional biopsy pathology and immunohistochemistry, NGS has unique advantages; NGS not only improves the diagnostic accuracy but also provides more possibilities for follow-up treatment strategies (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Whereas the workload of NGS is still large, and the cost is still high. And the technical defects of NGS can also affect the final test result. In this study, the patient had a previously unknown CCS mutation, CDKN2AB, which was identified with NGS, and the absence of CDKN2AB may lead to hyperimmune progression (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Moreover, we examined the PD-L1 expression and the immune microenvironment of this patient, which is the first time these were studied in CCS in the chest. However, this study also has obvious limitations. After the patient was diagnosed, we strongly recommended chemotherapy or immunotherapy, but the patient refused for economic reasons; therefore, we did not observe the patient's efficacy. However, this study suggests that bevacizumab appears to have some effect in treating pleural effusion within the cavity with CCS.
