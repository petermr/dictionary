<p>The immunophenotype of CCS is similar to that of melanoma, so CCS may have similar immunotherapy targets at similar immune checkpoints. PD-1- and PD-L1-associated antibodies have a wide range of antitumor effects and have been shown to benefit melanoma patients (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The PD-L1 antibody as a potential immunotherapy for CCS was not favorable in our patient, suggesting that CCS may lack relevant immune checkpoints. In the meantime, we further explored the tumor microenvironment of the pulmonary CCS to search for more effective therapeutic targets with immunofluorescence. The results suggest that drugs that target TIGIT could become a new treatment for CCS. In 2009, TIGIT was first discovered by Xin Yu (

Pre-clinical studies indicated that TIGIT blockade might protect against multiple solid and hematological cancers was confirmed in Pre-clinical studies (
