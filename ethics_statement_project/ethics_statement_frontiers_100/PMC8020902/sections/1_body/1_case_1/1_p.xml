<p>A 66-year-old Chinese male presented to a hospital in February 2020 with several months of episodic coughing and night sweats. A lesion (56×55 mm) in the right upper lung lobe was detected by computed tomographic (CT) imaging. The needle biopsy demonstrated non-small cell lung cancer with immunohistochemical results of Ki67(+, 70%), TTF(-), CD56(-), Syn(-), CgA(-), LCA(-), P40(+/-), CK5/6(+), CK(+), Napsin(-), CKpan(+), and P63(+/-), with a tendency to adenocarcinoma. Molecular analysis showed only 
 <italic>KRAS</italic> gene mutations and no mutations in the 
 <italic>EGFR, ROS1, RET, HER2, BRAF, NRAS</italic>, or 
 <italic>ALK</italic>. PD1 and PDL1 expression levels were not investigated due to patient's economic situation. Systemic evaluation showed the involvement of multiple lymph nodes (right supraclavicular region, mediastinum, and bilateral hilum of the lung), and possible brain metastases (5×7 mm) in the left frontal lobe. At this stage, the patient underwent chemotherapy (two cycles of TP: Paclitaxel and Nedaplatin).
