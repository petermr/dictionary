<p>A 32-year-old female with headache of two months' duration was admitted to our hospital in July 2017. MRI of the brain revealed multiple abnormal signals, with the largest lesion (27×41×27 mm) was located in the left cerebellar hemisphere. Chest CT revealed a mass (41×40 mm) in the lower lobar region of the left lung. Lung cancer with multiple brain metastases was suspected. Subsequently, the largest one was surgically removed to release the compressed fourth ventricle. Pathology revealed a poorly differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma, and the 
 <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation 19-Del was detected. After six cycles of chemotherapy-with gefitinib (Pemetrexeddisodium, PEM 1.0 g+ Nedaplatin, NDP 130 mg; gefitinib 250 mg qd) by sequential therapy, the response was evaluated as stable disease (SD). In August 2018, CT revealed enlargement of the left lower lobar lesion. One cycle of chemotherapy (PEM 1.0 g) was again undertaken. One month later, however, bone metastases appeared. After three cycles of chemotherapy (PEM 1.0 g+ NDP 120 mg), the lesion in the inferior lobe of the left lung had slightly increased compared to before. She refused the next cycle of chemotherapy and started taking Osimertinib (80 mg qd) instead of gefitinib.
