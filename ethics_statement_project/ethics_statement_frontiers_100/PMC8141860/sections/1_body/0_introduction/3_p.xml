<p>In 2011, Desai et al. (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) described a new set of instruments, initially designed to allow adequate renal access in PCNL under optical control. The objective was to achieve calyceal puncture and sheath placement in a single step. Therefore, we were able to reduce damage to renal parenchyma by percutaneous access. The procedure, which can use 2 types of small needles (8 Fr or 4.85 F), has been called "microperc‚Äù because of its small size. Subsequently, other authors presented their experience adding a three-way adapter that allows introducing a laser guide or fiber through it, in addition to the optic fiber and saline solution to distend the renal pelvis (
