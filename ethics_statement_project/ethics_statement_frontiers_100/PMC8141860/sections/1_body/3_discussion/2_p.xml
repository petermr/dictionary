<p>Recently, the appearance of smaller instruments has allowed new alternatives for the minimally invasive treatment of lithiasis. The "MicroPerc” system has been described as a new minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy technique that is performed with a 4.85 or 8 F metal needle. The technique was devised as a puncture system that allows access to the chosen calyx with vision at all times due to a fine optical fiber found in the needle (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) proposed using the needle as a percutaneous access sheath, which was able to reduce puncture and subsequent sheath placement to a single step after dilating the percutaneous tract. To do this, they preferably used the 8 Fr metal needle. The technique was called "microperc” because it achieved percutaneous access below 10 Fr. Furthermore, the three-way connection attached to the needle allows a 272 μm laser fiber to be passed through the needle to perform lithotripsy or endopyelotomy. Lithotripsy was performed with the basic modalities of fragmentation and pulverization. Irrigation with saline solution and a 0.9 mm flexible fiber optic connected to the telescope are added to the other 2 connections for an adequate view, transmitting the image from the tip of the sheath. Some authors used the "microperc” access in a limited number of children for the treatment of lithiasis or recurrent peiloureteral stenosis, demonstrating that this technique can also be considered safe in preschool children (
