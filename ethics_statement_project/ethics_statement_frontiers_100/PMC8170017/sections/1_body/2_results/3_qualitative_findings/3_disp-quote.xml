  <italic>The course is over, but I wish I could take it again. I am particularly impressed by the lesson of “Rainbow Island.” I learned that our lives are meaningful and useful. It is just like everything in nature. I used to think my life was worthless when I encountered difficulties, but I've learned to cherish my precious life</italic>.
