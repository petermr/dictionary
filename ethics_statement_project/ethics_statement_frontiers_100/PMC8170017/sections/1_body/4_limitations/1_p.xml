<p>The results of our study are limited by the lack of a control group, which would help reduce confounding biases. Additional studies should compare scores on the PILSEE for students in similar grades who did not enroll in the course on "Sailing through Adolescence.” This course was introduced to schools in 2014, and the validity or reliability of the questionnaire was not fully accomplished at that time. Due to the increasing attention to these issues from teachers and parents over the years, the retrospective validity and reliability of the questionnaire were amended, and some statistics were not measured. The last two questions of PILSEE were slightly revised in the new version after 2017. Although this course has potential to improve teenagers' attitudes toward adolescence, the course has only been offered for 6 years. A longitudinal study with follow-ups in adulthood will be needed to better assess the effects of "Sailing through Adolescence.”</p>
