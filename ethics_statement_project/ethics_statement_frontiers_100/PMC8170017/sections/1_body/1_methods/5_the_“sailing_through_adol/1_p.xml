<p>The “Sailing through Adolescence” course was offered in 12 weekly lessons over a period of 2–3 months and approved by the “Committee of School Curriculum Development” of all participating schools. The course was developed by three experts in sex education, gender equality education, and life-skills education for adolescents, which was based on cognition, affection, and behavior. Each lesson focuses on one specific topic. At the beginning of the course, students completed the PILSEE questionnaire for pre-test scores. Students were then presented with a “Treasure Map,” and stickers were pasted on areas of the map as a means of recording the contents of each lesson. A “Learning sheet” was also distributed to the students as a guide for reinforcing knowledge related to each lesson. Students summarized knowledge gained from each lesson with an activity called “Brother Parrot has something to say.” Students were encouraged to record and share their thoughts and impressions at the conclusion of each lesson. Details of the “Sailing through Adolescence” course are shown in
