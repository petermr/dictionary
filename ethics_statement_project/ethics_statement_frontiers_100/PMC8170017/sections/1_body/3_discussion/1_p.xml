<p>Our study results showed that the “Sailing through Adolescence” course for Life–Sex–Emotions was effective for improving the perceptions of students in grades 5 to 9 about adolescence, attitudes toward life, sex, mental health, and gender equality. These attitudes might also enhance adolescents' self-awareness, attitudes toward physical changes during adolescence, and sexual health.</p>
