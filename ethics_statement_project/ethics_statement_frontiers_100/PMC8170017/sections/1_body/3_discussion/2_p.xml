The second-level prevention is about early detection of students of high suicide risks and offering intervening counseling. The third level of prevention is to establish a crisis management system, which combines community resources to prevent further incidents of suicide. The course of "Sailing through Adolescence” improved students' self-esteem, which might also be included in first-level prevention of teenage suicide.
