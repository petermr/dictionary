<p>Although the themes noted in these interviews shed light on how women living near fracking operations make sense of their reproductive hardships, this study has limitations that warrant review. Miscarriage, stillbirth, birth defects, and difficulty with conception are deeply personal and even stigmatized issues, making women who have experienced such problems a population that is relatively hard to reach.
