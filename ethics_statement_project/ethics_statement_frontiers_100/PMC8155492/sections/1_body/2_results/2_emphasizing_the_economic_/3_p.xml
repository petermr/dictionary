<p>Rita and Lindsay invoked economic benefits as reason to dismiss or minimize environmental concerns, thus reducing cognitive dissonance. That is, although closure or even regulation of oil and gas operations could improve public health and safety, participants cognitively (and communicatively) constructed economic losses as simply too costly. As Rita noted, “[We] want to make things safe for all parties involved, but not to the point of regulating it so much that it can’t be done or used.” She thus argued that practices should be safe but only insofar as safety precautions did not infringe on the industry’s ability to frack and reap economic benefits. Rita elaborated, “[T]here comes a point where you can regulate something to death where you can no longer provide for your family. . . . if we regulate it to death, then you’re going to have a bunch of unemployed people.” Once again, the consequences of mitigating health and safety concerns were, for participants, too costly. Rita’s sentiments suggested that any concerns needed to be considered in light of economic benefits. Immediate economic livelihood took precedent over potential health and environmental impacts. Such constructions were necessary for participants to reduce dissonance, allowing them to view fracking as permissible even in the case of concerning health effects.</p>
