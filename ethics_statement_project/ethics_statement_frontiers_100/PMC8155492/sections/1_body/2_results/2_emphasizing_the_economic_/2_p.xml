<p>Participants frequently spoke to the positive economic outcomes of fracking operations. For example, Rita, a stay-at-home mom whose husband works in the oil and gas industry, noted that fracking enabled the construction of a new jail, a community conference center, and other public buildings, all of which were multimillion-dollar projects. She emphasized fracking as "important. . . . to our infrastructure, as well as just our work life.” In addition, Claudia, a stay-at-home mom with no immediate economic links to the industry (her husband works in healthcare), emphasized fracking as bringing substantial work to the community by bolstering business for "mom and pop shops” and creating employment for those who could work directly on fracking operations. Lindsay, who works for the health department and whose husband works as a miner, affirmed the dangers of fracking yet discussed it as a "necessary evil.” Though many of the women interviewed noted the dangers fracking poses to the environment, human health, and/or workers who risk injury or death on the job, the majority described economic benefits as substantial and essential.</p>
