<p>Claudia and Rita suggested that the fact that they grew up elsewhere made it unlikely that fracking in the Uintah Basin contributed to their reproductive hardship. When asked whether her experiences with miscarriage had impacted her perception of the fracking industry, Claudia replied, “I haven’t seen an impact of fracking. I also was not born and raised here. . . . So for me, no.” Rita emphasized the fact that she was originally from another area as reason to eliminate local fracking as a cause of her reproductive struggles: “I’ve dealt with reproductive issues, but I don’t think that they have anything to do with fracking. I didn’t originate here in the basin, and I haven’t always been around fracking and natural gas and all that stuff.” Rita also believed studies conducted in the region—designed to assess potential links between fracking chemicals and health—were flawed in that the majority of study participants “didn't originate from here . . . [and] didn't necessarily even work in the industry.” Rita and Claudia perceived fracking as only likely to impact the health of those who grew up near operations or had direct ties to the industry.</p>
