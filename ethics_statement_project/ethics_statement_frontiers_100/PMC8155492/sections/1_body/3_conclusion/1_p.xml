<p>This study aimed to address the dearth of literature discussing women's perceptions of reproductive hardship in relation to hydraulic fracturing operations. Through in-depth interviews, we sough to investigate how and to what extent women living in the Uintah Basin—an area economically dependent on hydraulic fracturing—perceived their reproductive hardships as related to local fracking operations. Our findings, explained through CDT, illustrate that those interviewed played up the economic benefits of fracking at the same time that they downplayed fracking as a potential contributor to their experiences with miscarriage and other reproductive challenges. Thus, it appears that women continue to bear personal responsibility for reproduction while echoing industry rhetoric that pits jobs against environmental welfare (

While such beliefs and communication patterns benefit such women in that they enable the reduction of dissonance, there is ample cause for concern in regards to health consequences caused by fracking operations. We want to conclude this paper by noting that a healthy economy is one that is sustainable in the long-term (
