<p>At baseline, participants reported sleep quality over a one-month time interval through the Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI), which contains seven "component” scores: sleep quality, latency, duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). A global score of subjective sleep quality (range 0–21) was then determined by the sum of the seven component scores with the higher scores representing poorer subjective sleep quality (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Participants were asked their bedtime, time of falling asleep, rise time, and sleep duration. Bedtime was categorized to "before 9 p.m., after 11 p.m., and 9–11 p.m.”; and rise time was categorized to "before 6 a.m., after 8 a.m., and 6–8 a.m.”
