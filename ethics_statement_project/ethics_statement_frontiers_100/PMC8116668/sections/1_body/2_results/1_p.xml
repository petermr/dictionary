<p>We evaluated 1,051 community-dwelling older men and women without dementia. As shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, 238 (22.8%), 675 (64.5%), and 133 (12.7%) participants reported going to bed before 9 p.m., between 9 and 11 p.m., and after 11 p.m., respectively. A total of 272 (26%), 626 (59.9%), and 148 (14.2%) participants reported getting up before 6 a.m., between 6 and 8 a.m., and after 8 a.m., respectively. The "early birds” (who reported going to bed earlier) had a lower education level, were less likely to be smokers and drinkers, less likely to do physical activity, more likely to have hypertension or diabetes, more likely to be an APOE e4 carrier, and had lower MMSE scores at baseline and follow-up compared to the "night owls” (who reported going to bed later). Over an average of 7.3 years of follow-up, we found 47 (8.0%) incident dementia cases among 584 study participants who completed the follow-up interview. The highest dementia incidence was found in participants who reported going to bed before 9 p.m., and the lowest dementia incidence was found in those who reported going to bed after 11 p.m. (
