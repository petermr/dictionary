<p>Another explanation for not vaccinating one's children can be an underestimation of a disease's consequences. Furthermore, people show a tendency to appraise the risk of a hazard based on their own feelings. For example, people generally evaluate human hazards more negatively than natural hazards ("affect-heuristic”) (

In addition to this, the negative evaluation of an uncommunicated risk is less strong than the negative appraisal of a communicated risk (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In terms of vaccination, this means: talking about even very rare adverse effects of a vaccination is assessed more negatively than disease symptoms that people do not know about. Even if the objectively judged risk of the effects of the disease is much higher, the appraisal of the potential side-effects of the vaccination is weighted more heavily. This phenomenon is known as "negativity bias” (
