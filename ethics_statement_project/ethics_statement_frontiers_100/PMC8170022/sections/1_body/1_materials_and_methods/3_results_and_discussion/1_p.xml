<p>Overall, this event was easily incorporated into an introductory laboratory and additional costs were minimal. The largest costs were purchasing coordinating T-shirts and rental of handwashing stations. To reduce these costs, the campus bathrooms could be used though the timing of 20 s could be harder to maintain. Coordinating shirts are not necessary for such a campaign, but it is helpful and could be arranged by wearing school colors or spirit shirts the students already own. The most common comment from students was that it was harder than they thought to engage with their fellow students. Popcorn and syringe pens were great incentives for engagement, and based on the amount of surveys collected, we interacted with over 400 students. The most common comment from participants was their surprise at how long 20 s is and their admission that they do not typically wash their hands for that long. Participants were also asked to respond to two separate surveys each containing more than ten questions. Due to the number of questions, the results were not completed by the end of the class so shorter surveys would be suggested. It was revealed that less than 50% of the students reported that they washed their hands for the recommended 15–20 s. Students were not surprised by this but seeing the statistics from a group familiar to them made the statistic more “real,” and we discussed how they might approach the issue in their future careers. In regard to the vaccination survey, it was shown that most of the participants believe that immunizations are an important part of a healthy lifestyle, but students were quick to point out that the size of the minority that was either neutral or disagreed (11%) with the statement was not ideal. Since participation time is limited in the described campaign, a deeper understanding of vaccination programs by participants would be more likely if the campaign was coordinated with a keynote speaker from the state or county health department.</p>
