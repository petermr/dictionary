<p>The campaign was incorporated into three sections of the MICRB202 Introduction to Microbiology laboratory course at Penn State Erie in the fall 2017 semester. In the weeks preceding the event, students were asked to do several assignments and discuss the campaign during a portion of the laboratory session. Students were asked to design handwashing advertisements stressing that the good handwashing requires 20 s of scrubbing with soap. The advertisements were then placed throughout the campus (student union eatery and bathrooms). Central to the campaign were handwashing demonstrations. For this, several portable handwashing stations were rented so proper handwashing techniques could be demonstrated using Glitterbug potion and viewing stations (Brevis Corporation). For the vaccine portion of the campaign, groups of 2â€“4 students were assigned one of four vaccines: MMR, meningitis, human papilloma virus, or influenza, to research and present to the class. From their research, students were asked to develop multiple-choice or true/false questions that could be used as trivia questions during the campaign. Survey questions were developed to understand participants' views regarding handwashing and vaccinations. Handwashing surveys asked when students washed their hands after five daily activities, how long they wash their hands, four agree/disagree statements, and two questions regarding hand sanitizers for a total of 13 questions. Vaccine surveys contained five agree/disagree statements and 11 yes/no questions that focused on some general thoughts toward vaccination programs, an understanding of the term herd immunity, and some specific questions regarding the flu, measles, meningitis, and HPV vaccines (these were chosen because they are either required or highly recommended before attending college). Surveys were done on paper, and participants needed to circle their answers.</p>
