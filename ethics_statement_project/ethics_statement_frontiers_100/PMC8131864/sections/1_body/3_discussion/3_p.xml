<p>The VOM, coming from the ligament of Marshall running between the left atrial appendage and left pulmonary vein antrum, is an intracardiac structure connects with the coronary sinus. Several studies showed the nervous system forms an interconnected neural network composed of GPs and VOM (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Valderrabano demonstrated that the VOM contains ICN that connects with the AV node and can trigger AF and retrograde ethanol infusion in the VOM reliably eliminates local ICN responses (

Importantly, the changes were alleviated when VOM was filled with alcohol. These phenomena confirm that the VOM is an important inter-communication pathway of GPs, and its participation in the development of vagal-related AF.
