<p>In our study, ultrasound features are analyzed to study the correlation with large-volume CLNM in PTMC and CPTC. However, no predictive factor is established. The possible reason is that ultrasonography in investigating CLNM is not sensitive and ultrasonography diagnosis is subjective, mainly relying on doctor’s clinical experience (

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In presence studies, radiomics and deep machinery learning are gradually conducted to investigate the CLNM. The highest sensitivity has reach 0.858 in the existing predictive models of CLNM, which is significantly higher than the current situation (lower than 0.5 for predicting CLNM) (
