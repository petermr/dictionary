<p>A total of 976 PTC patients who received primary total thyroidectomy with central lymph node dissection treatment in the Department of General Surgery at Guangdong General Hospital between October 2017 to September 2019 were reviewed retrospectively in this study. The study was approved by Research Ethics Committee of Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences. All patients gave their informed consent to the collection of data according to the local ethic committee indications. Ultrasound examination (US) was routinely performed to assess the thyroid and lymph node status in all these patients. Computed tomography scan (CT) and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) were used only in some patients as needed. Patients were diagnosed PTC with LNM by pathological examination in the Pathology Department. LNM was defined as preoperatively cN1 with following signs in preoperative ultrasound examination: the ration of transverse/long diameter in cervical lymph node &gt;0.5, blurred corticomedullary boundary, vanished medulla structure, microcalcification or cystic changes (
