<p>Divided by the maximum diameter of the tumor, clinicopathologic characteristic were tested in PTMC patients and CPTC patients, respectively. In 232 PTMC patients, male, multifocality, nodule goiter and capsule invasion were significantly correlated with large-volume CLNM (

  <bold>Table 4</bold>
 </xref>, only capsule invasion (OR: 2.845, 95% CI: 1.110–7.288, P= 0.029) was still significant predictive factors for large-volume CLNM. In 132 CPTC patients, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, marked hypoechoicity, irregular margin and tumor diameter (&gt;2cm) were significantly correlated with large-volume CLNM (

 </xref>, tumor diameter (&gt;2cm) (OR: 3.757, 95% CI: 1.061–13.310, P= 0.04) was significant predictive factors for large-volume CLNM. The high sensitivities and low false-negative rates (1- specificity) associated with the tumor diameter were identified

  <bold>Figure 1</bold>
 </xref>. The Area Under Curve (AUC) =0.682(p=0.013), the best cut-off point was selected as 2.0 cm, which meant that CPTC patients with tumor diameter higher than 2.0cm had more likelihood to have large-volume CLNM.
