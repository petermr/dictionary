<p>Cutaneous melanoma (CMM) is a skin tumor with a high degree of malignancy and rising incidence (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), with a larger tumor volume positively correlating with an increased prognostic risk of patients (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Thus, in the related field, exploring the mechanisms underlying the occurrence and development CMM have become a main research direction for improve CMM patients' prognosis. The discovery of missense mutation of the BRAF gene is one of the most influential developments in the study of CMM, as inn more than half of CMM cases, the valine at position 600 of the BRAF protein is replaced by glutamic acid (BRAF
 <sup>V600E</sup>) (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Studies found that BRAF
 <sup>V600E</sup> mutation is related to a higher chance of developing tumor metastasis and lower survival rate of CMM patients (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). As a potent kinase inhibitor selectively targeting BRAF
 <sup>V600E</sup> mutation in tumor cells, Verofini (PLX 4032) has a therapeutic effect on patients with metastatic melanoma with BRAF
 <sup>V600E</sup> mutations and could improve the overall survival of CMM patients (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, PLX 4032 is prone to develop drug resistance within 6-8 months of treatment, greatly imposing the difficulty of clinical treatment of CMM patients (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).
