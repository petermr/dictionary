<p>Moreover, the activity of YAP1 in the epidermis may be independent of the Hippo signaling pathway, and is mainly controlled by adhesion junctions and downstream signal transduction of integrins as well as by the mechanical force transmitted and applied by the associated actin cytoskeleton. The mechanical signal, which affects the activity of YAP1 in the epidermis, plays a major role in the regulation of YAP/TAZ in fibroblasts (

To further determine the expression of YAP1 in drug-resistant CMM and the effect of mechanical signals of UMMD on its expression, this research further applied RNA-seq, Ribo-seq and QPCR to explore the effects of UMMD treatment on CMM mouse tumor tissues 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. The results showed that only Ribo-seq UMMD and US showed the up-regulated YAP1 expression, with the expression of YAP1 in Ribo-seq inversely proportional to tumor growth, noticeably, the effect of UMMD treatment on YAP1 expression was the most obvious. Ribo-seq greatly facilitates the acquirement of ribosome distribution by sequencing "ribosome protected fragments‚Äù, and can analyze the translation efficiency and translation mode of genes on ribosomes (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Ribo-seq serves as an indicator of instantaneous protein synthesis efficiency and stable transcription level. The core of this method is that translated ribosome protects a short fragment of mRNA from nuclease activation, thereby accurately recording the position in which translation takes place. Thus, Ribo-seq could sensitively and effectively detect protein changes in cells (
