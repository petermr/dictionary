<p>To address this issue, we measured plasma levels of 25(OH)D, testosterone and 17β-estradiol from 160 adult patients (80 females and 80 males divided in four subgroups: A, 40 pre-menopausal females under 45 years; B, 40 males under 45 years; C, 40 post-menopausal females over 55 years; D, 40 males over 55 years) admitted to Lazzaro Spallanzani Hospital, Rome, Italy between March and September 2020, positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT–PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and able to provide informed consent. Plasma samples were collected at clinical admission. Partial pressure of oxygen/inspired oxygen concentration ratio (PaO2/FiO2 ratio), representing a valuable clinical measure of the patient’s respiratory status, were recorded during clinical admission. ELISA kits for 25(OH)D (MyBioSource, San Diego, CA, United States) testosterone (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, United States) and 17β-estradiol (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) were used according to manufactures’ instructions. Statistical analysis was performed by the Mann–Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test and Spearman’s rank correlation using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, United States). A 
 <italic>p</italic> value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.
