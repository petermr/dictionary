  <p>Median age (min-max) was 61 years (26–78), there were seven females and nine males. (
   <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) All patients continued home treatment without interruption. The same nurse supported the patient at time zero and after three months, the questionnaire was administered, on both occasions, on the day scheduled for replacement therapy. During the observation time, no adverse events occurred. All the questionnaires completed at 3 months showed an increase in score compared to the questionnaire completed during the last hospital administration session. The quality of life had improved from an index of 18.0 ± 3.0 at the start time (t0) to an index of 22.6 ± 3.3 after 3 months (t3). (
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) The variation was statistically significant (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). For all patients, the scores of the symptom control questions ("I cough”, "I bring up phlegm”, "I have shortness of breath”, "I have attacks of wheezing”) were unchanged. Instead, all sixteen patients, when asked "my (augmentation) therapy interferes with my life", answered "very much" or "much" at time zero, and "few times” or "not at all" after three months. Also, to the question "my respiratory disease is a nuisance to my family, friends or neighbors?" the same patients responded "very much" or "much" at time zero and "few times" or "not at all" after three months. Seven patients provided written comment. Three explained that the advantage of home therapy was to be independent of a family member or friend who had to accompany them to the hospital. Three others wrote that they could undergo home therapy without losing working or university day. These patients reported being very stressed while going to the hospital to undergo intravenous therapy. This was especially true for patients who lived far away from the hospital. Only one patient reported feeling safer when he was treated at the hospital than at home because he felt he was monitored more carefully.
