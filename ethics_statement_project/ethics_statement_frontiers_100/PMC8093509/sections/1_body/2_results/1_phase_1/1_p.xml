<p>With respect to the "generic attributes” lists, there was consensus among the groups at the Divisional retreat regarding the following attributes: Integrity/Ethics/Morality, Reflective practitioner, Evidence informed/Critical thinker, and Compassionate clinician. As such, a decision was needed only for the fifth attribute, with the options being Interprofessional, Collaborator, or Culturally Component. For the "branding attributes” lists there were three common attributes across all groups: Scholarly/scholarship, Advocate, and Leadership/Capacity for leadership. There was also agreement between two out of three groups for each of the remaining attributes. Consequently, there were only three attributes remaining from which the final two needed to be selected: Clinical strength/expertise, Capacity builder, and Innovator. Thus, the voting for the final panels of attributes only required choosing one final "generic” and two final "branding” attributes. The final lists of attributes determined through this process are presented in
