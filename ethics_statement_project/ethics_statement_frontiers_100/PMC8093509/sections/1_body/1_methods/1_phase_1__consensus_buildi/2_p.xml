<p>In order to further streamline attribute lists as well as maximize input and consensus regarding these lists, the project team undertook a consensus building exercise at the 2017 Divisional retreat. At that retreat, the selection committee's plan to move from two semi-structured interviews to four attributes-based Modified Personal Interviews (MPI) (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) was summarized. It was reviewed that the priority attributes would serve as the criteria being assessed for resident selection, based on the file review and MPIs. A consensus-building activity was undertaken to determine the final list of attributes. For this activity, participants were divided into three groups and each group was provided with the lists of these words are an error eleven "branding attributes” and ten "generic attributes.” Each group was tasked with choosing their top five priority attributes from each list. To enhance engagement, the groups were given the freedom to determine how they achieved consensus. Each group then presented their lists and discussed why they chose to prioritize those specific attributes. As the groups presented their lists it became evident that there was already a great deal of overlap and consensus between the lists. Following each group's presentation and discussion of the notable commonalities and differences, participants were asked to anonymously vote on their preferred panels of attributes, resulting in the final panels of attributes chosen by vote (
