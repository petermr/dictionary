<p>Five of the eight journals provided instructions for authors regarding the disclosure of COIs, which, in our interpretation, included requirements to disclose clinical and/or training roles (readers are again referred to 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For four of the five journals with false statements regarding COIs, these statements were in violation of journal policy regarding COI disclosures. For two of three journals that did not provide COI policies (the 
 <italic>Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis</italic> and the 
 <italic>Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior</italic>), there were no COI statements included in any of the articles reviewed. For the third journal (
 <italic>Behavior Modification</italic>), all 15 articles selected for inclusion provided identical COI statements: “The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.” Despite these statements, all 15 articles were coded as having at least one author with a clinical and/or training consultancy COI. It is unclear how COIs were defined for these authors in the submission instructions, or at what point in the submission process they were prompted to provide this statement. Six of the eight journals are COPE members, and five of the six (all but 
 <italic>The Psychological Record</italic>) published articles falsely claiming that authors did not have COIs.
