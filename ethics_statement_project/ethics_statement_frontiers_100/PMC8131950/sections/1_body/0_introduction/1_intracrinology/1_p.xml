<p>Intracrinology refers to the production of active sex steroids 
 <italic>in situ</italic> within the cells where the action takes place. The active hormones are not released in the extracellular space (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) as opposed to endocrinology where glands release active hormones in circulation to exert their effect on target tissues. The term "intracrinology‚Äù has been coined 30 years ago during the study of the prostate (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). It has been shown that after removing androgens of testicular origin, the prostate still produces dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from an inactive circulating sex steroid precursor of adrenal origin. Can this concept of intracrinology be extended to the developing lung?
