<p>Hematoma of the colon took place after a subcutaneous LMWH injection. The patient had no medical history of hemorrhagic diseases, trauma, and any other anticoagulation therapy; we suspected that it was an adverse drug reaction (ADR) of LMWH. The assessment of ADR was evaluated 
 <italic>via</italic> the Naranjo probability scale (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Naranjo et al., 1981</xref>), which helps to identify the causal relation between an ADR and a drug based on the validated clinical questionnaire set by domain experts. The Naranjo scale consists of 10 questions which are administered for each patient's clinical record. The Naranjo scale assigns a causality score, which is the sum of the scores of all Naranjo questions, that classifies the case into one of four causality types: doubtful (≤0), possible (1–4), probable (5–8), and definite (≥9). This patient had a Naranjo probability score of 8, which indicated that LMWH was a probable cause of this bleeding event. All the above examinations revealed a final diagnosis of hematoma of the colon, a rare ADR caused by LMWH therapy.
