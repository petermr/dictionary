<p>On March 21, laboratory results showed that N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide was 1590 pg/ml, international normalized ratio was 1.14, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was 38.20 s, fibrinogen was 1.67 g/L, hemoglobin was 113 g/L, red blood cell count was 3.34 × 10
 <sup>12</sup>/L, creatinine was 83 μmol/L, alanine transferase was (ALT) 39.0 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 36.0 U/L, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) was 115.0 U/L, and platelet cell count was 183 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L. After anticoagulation therapy for 3 days, an emergency laboratory test showed that the red blood cell count was 2.56 × 10
 <sup>12</sup>/L, and hemoglobin and platelet counts decreased to 82 g/L and 102 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L, respectively. Furthermore, the coagulation function test demonstrated a prolonged APTT of 49.50 s. There was no bleeding per rectum, and his fecal occult blood test was negative. Considering the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and the rapid drop in hemoglobin and red blood cell count, there was clinical suspicion for retroperitoneal or gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
