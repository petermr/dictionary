<p>For recruitment, the study was advertised in social media with support from the self-help group on VS, "Eye on Vision Foundation” (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eyeonvision.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.eyeonvision.org/</ext-link>). We first assessed the eligibility of interested patients during telephone interviews conducted by a headache specialist familiar with VSS. The interview was cross-checked by a second headache specialist. Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 years and presence of VSS (subtype black and white dots) in accordance with the criteria published previously (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Exclusion criterion was intake of any illicit drugs currently or within 2 weeks prior to the onset of VSS. Brain MRI was normal in all subjects. Later, the VSS patients were examined at presentation by one of the two mentioned specialists. Of medications known to possibly affect cortical excitability, only one patient was on lamotrigine and three patients were on mirtazapine. Travel expenses were reimbursed, and no further payment was made for study participation. Patients with VSS were compared to age- and migraine-matched subjects.
