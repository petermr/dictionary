<p>Seventeen patients with visual snow syndrome (six females and 11 males; mean age, 30.0 ± 10.8 years; 12 with comorbid migraine, seven of them also with typical migraine aura) were compared to 17 control subjects (C) (14 females and three males; mean age, 28.3 ± 8.2 years; 12 with comorbid migraine, none of them with typical migraine aura). The groups did differ in gender (χ = 7.77 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and aura (χ = 8.82 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003), but not in migraine (χ = 0, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1) and age χ = 16.87, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.66. For more information on study population, see the
