<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, all standardized factor loadings of questions are from 0.699 to 0.894. All composite reliability of the constructs ranging from 0.839 to 0.913 and Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.828 to 0.913 exceed 0.7 as recommended by 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Nunnally and Bernstein (1994)</xref>, indicating that all constructs have internal consistency. Lastly, the average variance extracted (AVE) of the constructs ranging from 0.633 to 0.777 exceed 0.5 as suggested by 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Hair et al. (2010)</xref>, showing that all constructs have adequate convergent validity. These results demonstrated that all measurement items had convergent validity.
