<p>Preventive measures in this research were taken in order to reduce the common method bias (CMB) that may result from sample collection of a single respondent's cognitive information by self-reported measurement items and decrease the impact of CMB. In addition to anonymous surveys, this research attempted to hide the meaning of each question and separate measurement items for different constructs as much as possible. The variable results in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref> had an appropriate degree of construct validity, which also indicated that the results were not largely affected by CMB. In addition, this study adopted Harman's single-factor test to evaluate the severity of CMB (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Podsakoff et al., 2003</xref>). The model fit of the CFA for the 24 measurement items in this study was better than the single-factor model of CFA significantly. This result could be seen that the impact of CMB was not serious in this research.
