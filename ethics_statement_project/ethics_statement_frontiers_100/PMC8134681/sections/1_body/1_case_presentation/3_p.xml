<p>Molecular genetic analysis was ordered when the girl was 7 month-23-day old. Genomic DNA was extracted from the infant's and her parents' peripheral blood using a whole blood genomic DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, German). DNA fragments were enriched using the Agilent SureSelect XT Human All Exon 50 Mb kit (Santa Clara, CA). Then DNA libraries were sequenced on the HiSeq2000/2500 sequencer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The data analysis method followed the pipeline established in-house (Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The criteria of the molecular diagnosis followed the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines. We classified the variant to be a pathogenic variant, according to PVS1+PM2+PP4. UPD was detected using "B Allele Frequency” (BAF) (van Riet et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The distribution of variant heterozygosity on each chromosome was calculated to scan the UPD event. The nonsense variant of 
 <italic>PCSK1</italic> was confirmed by Sanger sequencing using ABI 3,730 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Agilent SurePrint G3 comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and SNP 4 × 180K microarray (Agilent Technologies, USA) was used to confirm the UPD(5) following the manufacturer's instructions. We used Agilent Cytogenomics software package for CNVs and the absence of heterozygosity (AOH) calling and visualization.
