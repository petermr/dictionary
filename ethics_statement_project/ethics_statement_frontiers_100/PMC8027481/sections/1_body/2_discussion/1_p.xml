<p>Typically, borderline or malignant PT do not involve multiple lesions, and most of them form unilateral disease. The total tumor size of surgical specimens ranges from no residue after biopsy to 38Â cm, while the size of PT is larger for malignant PT (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This patient had a unilateral giant borderline PT; the tumor grew rapidly within 3 months, which made the skin of the left breast tight and thin. The huge mass caused ischemia and formed ischemic ulcers. In addition, the patient developed severe hypoglycemia prior to surgery. Pancreatic magnetic resonance imaging and serological examinations ruled out the possibility of insulinomas. One day after surgery, the blood glucose and insulin levels of the patient rapidly returned to normal. Postoperative immunohistochemical staining results were as follows: IGF-2(+), CKpan (+), SMA (+), Desmin (+). Thus, the patient's preoperative hypoglycemia may have been non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH).
