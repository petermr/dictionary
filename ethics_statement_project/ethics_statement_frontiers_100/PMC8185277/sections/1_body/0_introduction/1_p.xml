<p>Tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2020</xref>). The most common form of TB is pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), which accounts for about 85% of all TB cases and poses a serious threat to global health (

 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB) itself or specific biomarkers of the host immune response (

Although the detection of MTB DNA using Gene Xpert or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can improve the sensitivity and provide quicker results than cultivation to a certain extent, nearly half of PTB patients were clinically diagnosed by PTB only by manifestations, radiographic imaging and laboratory examination without an aetiological evidence, especially in low- and middle-income countries with constrained resources and a high PTB prevalence (
