<p>For this purpose, the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) personality questionnaire was used due to the study time acceptable for the competitive players in voluntary research. For this study, the NEOAC acronym was adopted. The questionnaire consists of 60 self-descriptive statements, the truthfulness of which in relation to themselves was assessed by the respondents on a five-point scale, varying from the statement “definitely not” to the statement “definitely yes.” NEO-FFI has sten norms for five age groups (15–19, 20–29, 30–39, 40–49, and 50–80), developed separately for women and men on the basis of large population samples. In addition, it is internally compatible. The obtained results allow for a full description of the respondents’ personality in terms of the Big Five and for forecasting their adaptation possibilities to the professional sport environment (
