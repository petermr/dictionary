<p>In this work, we included sex, age, the first 40 genomic principal components (PC1–PC40, see ref. (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Bycroft et al., 2018</xref>) as an example of using first 40 PCs in phenotyping–genomic data analysis), 9 PRSs (PRS.0, PRS.1, and PRS.2-8), as well as parental height, parental age, the first 40 PCs of parents, and 9 parental PRSs as potential predictors. The genomic principal components were obtained based on the UKB genotyped variants using a set of 407,219 unrelated, high-quality samples and 147,604 high-quality markers ref. (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Tsao and Vasan, 2015</xref>). In total, there were 153 potential predictors that may potentially affect the value of height. Identification of the most accurate and parsimonious prediction model is accomplished by the model selection approaches. In other words, we used a "hypothesis-free” approach and let the data determine which predictors should go or stay.
