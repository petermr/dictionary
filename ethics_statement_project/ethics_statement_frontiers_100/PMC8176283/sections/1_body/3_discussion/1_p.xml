<p>Our study is the first to evaluate the predictive value of adult height, using all possible variables including parental height, the proband's age and sex, genetic principal components, and millions of individual SNPs. By incorporating parental height, we were able to examine how "family history‚Äù incrementally improves height prediction beyond traditional factors such as age and sex and genetic factors such as PCs and even millions of significantly and marginally associated SNPs. We demonstrated the power of combining all these together to reach the most accurate prediction of adult height to our knowledge yet identified, with an

We speculate that the reason the parental PRSs are effective with the presence of parental height is that the parental height is in composite of known and unknown exposures, such as environmental effects and dining habit, rather than additive genetic effects.
