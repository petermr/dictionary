<p>In summary, our analyses demonstrated that parental height contributes to predicting adult height, even after accounting for a predictive value of &gt;30,000 SNPs. Therefore, it is crucial for future statistical models to consider parental phenotypes that may potentially capture the missing heritability better, for example, Alzheimer’s disease, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.</p>
