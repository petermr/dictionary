<p>Evidence-based medicine was the template for the American Psychological Association's policy statement for evidence-based practice in psychology (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Levant, 2005</xref>). The authors of the policy-statement declares that [e]vidence-based practice in psychology is […] consistent with the past 20 years of work in evidence-based medicine (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Levant, 2005</xref>, p. 271). Evidence-based practice in psychology is defined as: "the integration of the best available research with clinical expertise in the context of patient characteristics, culture, and preferences” (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">American Psychological Association, 2006</xref>, p. 273). However, evidence-based practice in psychology is an unsuccessful attempt to create a tripartite model. It actually exists of only one part, which is best available research. Thus, clinical expertise and patient characteristics, culture and preferences are in fact scientific sub-categories (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Berg, 2019</xref>). In addition, the integration of these (alleged) three parts have not been substantiated. It is the clinical expert that must integrate the different elements in evidence-based practice. Thus, the competence of the clinician must somehow reflect the three (alleged) parts in evidence-based practice in psychology (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Berg, 2020</xref>). The consequence of these failings is that evidence-based practice in psychology contains a direct link from scientific evidence to clinical practice. In spite of major short-comings, it continues to be the dominating regulating principle for psychotherapy practice (
