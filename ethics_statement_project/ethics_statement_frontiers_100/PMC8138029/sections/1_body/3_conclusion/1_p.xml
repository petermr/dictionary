<p>Because the policy-statement for evidence-based practice in psychology aims at regulating practice through scientific and extra-scientific parameters, it should encompass the difference between science and practice. In the current version of the policy-statement there is a failed attempt to achieve this. This does not only lead to a series of misunderstandings as to what makes psychotherapy "work,‚Äù but also with misunderstandings of what psychotherapy 
 <italic>is</italic>. Ultimately, the distance from science (as it is defined in evidence-based practice in psychology) to clinical practice is considerable, because the former deal with empirical regularities at a group level and the latter deal with the realisation of a better life at the level of the individual. Without sorting out these misconstructions, there is little hope that evidence-based practice in psychology could serve as a satisfactory regulatory principle.
