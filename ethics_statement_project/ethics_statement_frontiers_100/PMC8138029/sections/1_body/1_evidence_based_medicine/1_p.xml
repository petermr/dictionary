<p>The legacy of Cochrane prevails in evidence-based medicine and other evidence-based health-care practices. The effectiveness-efficiency distinction exists (albeit in new forms) in most evidence-based medicine models (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Sackett, 1997</xref>). However, there are some notable differences between Cochrane's thinking and evidence-based medicine. Whereas 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cochrane (1999)</xref> insisted that randomised controlled trials are necessary to provide best treatment, contemporary evidence-based medicine's conceptualisation of best evidence is more flexible (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Guyatt and Rennie, 2002</xref>). These models have an evidence-based hierarchy ranging randomised controlled trials (and compilations of randomised controlled trials in systematic reviews and meta-analyses) as the most stringent types of evidence. However, through the GRADE-system, research studies are evaluated and ranked from "high” to "very low.” Accordingly, randomised controlled trials with biases can have a ranking of "low” or even "very low” and observational studies can have a ranking of "moderate” or "high.” Although the GRADE-system determine treatment efficacy, it is also relevant for the understanding of effectiveness. Once it is recognised that different kinds of methodologies, and not only randomised controlled trials, can provide useful insight, it opens up for the active interpretation of evidence. The latter versions of evidence-based medicine emphasise the clinical importance of a clinical expert and de-emphasise the direct clinical importance of randomised controlled trials (
