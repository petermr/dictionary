<p>In contrast to Cochrane's model, the more recent evidence-based medicine models are tripartite and consists of best external evidence, clinical expertise and patient values (

In accordance with Cochrane, the clinical expert is deemed necessary to convert the best external evidence into best clinical practice. Whereas science consists of propositions typically describing effects, clinical experts translate the scientific findings in a given clinical context. Second, patient values must be included in treatment. This sharpens the distinction between efficacy and efficiency, because patient preferences might diverge from the evidence base. According to this ideal, a treatment can hardly be called efficient, if its effects are not welcomed by the patient. Thus, in the tripartite evidence-based medicine models, efficiency entails individualised treatments.
