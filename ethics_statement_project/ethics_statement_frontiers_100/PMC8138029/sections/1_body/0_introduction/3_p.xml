<p>There is an often-overlooked political ambition of Cochrane's thinking, which was to provide effective health-care treatment available for everyone. This political aim led him to coin a second term. Efficiency includes factors such as the economic cost of various treatment options and the optimal use of staff and equipment. Efficiency is the translation of scientific research in clinical setting, taking the most important external (i.e., extra-scientific) factors into consideration. By distinguishing effectiveness and efficiency, Cochrane underscored that clinical science differs from clinical practice. Whereas the models of science constructively reduce complexity, the reduction of complexity in clinical practice is associated with the risk of suboptimal clinical care.</p>
