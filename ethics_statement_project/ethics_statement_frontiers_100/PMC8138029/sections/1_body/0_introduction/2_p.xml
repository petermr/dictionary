<p>Cochrane used the term "effectiveness” to denote the scientific merits of a given treatment. Cochrane recognises that he uses the term effectiveness to denote what is commonly coined "efficacy” (which he avoids simply because he dislikes the word). More specifically, effectiveness refers to the causal effects of a treatment. A treatment is deemed "effective” if scientific findings indicates that it causes a given change in the health status of its recipients. According to Cochrane, randomised controlled trials are superior in bringing about information of causal factors. Due to their lack of bias, randomised controlled trials let researchers draw unequivocal inferences (of whether a treatment is effective or not). Thus, there is an implicit methodological hierarchy in Cochrane's ideal for clinical science, but Cochrane's ideal for science and practice are not identical.</p>
