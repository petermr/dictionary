<p>In our study, 22 out of 30 BAL samples revealed mild to moderate blood contamination (&lt;10 red blood cells/field, 100X objective, oil immersion – 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) and 10 out of 30 had mild oropharyngeal contamination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Oropharyngeal contamination is recognized by the presence of squamous epithelial cells. These cells are large, angular, with a small ovoid nucleus, centrally located in the cell. Chromatin is dense and devoid of nuclei. The cytoplasm is abundant and can be transparent, light pink to blue depending on the stain. Numerous bacteria can be present at the surface of the cell, originating from the "normal” microbiota of the oral cavity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Bacteria from oropharyngeal contamination are extracellular and do not impact the differential cell counts. Oropharyngeal contamination had no statistical effect on differential cell counts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). A slightly yet significant higher percentage of lymphocytes (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) was observed in samples with mild blood contamination—median without blood contamination: 12% [95% CI, 1–21%]; median with blood contamination: 17% [95% CI, 13–26%]—with a concurrent slight decrease in the percentage of macrophages (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05). Neutrophils and eosinophils were not statistically affected.
