<p>Patient characteristics in the "HOS” and "No HOS” groups were balanced in respect to BMI (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.909), sex (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.566), and ASA (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.083, 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Patients with HOS were older than patients without HOS (57 vs. 48 years, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.002). The analysis of risk factors for the development of a HOS showed significant differences for the diagnosis on which ileostomy was based. Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) developed HOS significantly more often than patients with UC, carcinoma or other diagnoses (CD: 23.4%, UC: 7.1%, carcinoma: 9.6%, varia: 20%; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.012). Apart from arterial hypertension (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.023), no other secondary diagnoses (COPD, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney failure, heart failure, diabetes mellitus) or immunosuppressive drugs or smoking showed influence on the development of HOS.
