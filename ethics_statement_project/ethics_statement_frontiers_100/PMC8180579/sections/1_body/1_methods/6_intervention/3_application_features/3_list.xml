   <bold>Symptoms Self-report:</bold> SarveDigital will help COVID-19 patients record their symptoms and, thus, their physician will be able to monitor and control their condition from a distance. Patients will be asked to enter their health symptoms such as fever, sore throat, dry cough, difficulty breathing or the shortness of breath, and loss of taste or smell at least three times a week into the application. Each symptom will be rated on a 4-point scale (e.g., "no fever,” "mild fever,” "moderate fever,” and "high fever”).
  </p>
  <p>These data will automatically be sent to the physicians' portal so that the physician will be aware of the patient's health status. It should be noted that the attending physician and the psychologist assigned will be able to access physicians' portal via their mobile phone with a username and password. This will ensure the privacy and security of the patient's information and the relevant classified information (
