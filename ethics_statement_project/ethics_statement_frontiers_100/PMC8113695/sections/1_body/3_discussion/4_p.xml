<p>In this study, a low dose of FUDR was administrated continuously 
 <italic>via</italic> HAI pump. FUDR is a suitable agent for HAI due to its unique characteristics as compared with 5-Fu, such as shorter half-life, higher systemic clearance rate, and higher liver extraction rate (

In the present study, 97.8% of patients (60/62) achieved intrahepatic disease control, including 67.7% PR and 8.1% CR. Although no patients underwent resection, the sustained intrahepatic response helped to prevent liver-related complications, which may immediately threaten the patient's life (
