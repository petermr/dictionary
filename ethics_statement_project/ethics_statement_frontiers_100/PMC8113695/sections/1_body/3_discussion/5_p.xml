<p>In this study, HAI pump system was implanted by two different teams, with modified radiological techniques as described previously (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Similar catheter functionality was achieved in the two centers. HAI pump dysfunction occurred in four patients (5.7%), including one catheter occlusion, one hepatic artery occlusion, and two infections, but none of them happened within the first 3 months. For HAI therapy, many research studies prefer surgery rather than radiological procedure to implant HAI pump system (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), due to concerns about frequent dislodgement and extrahepatic infusion related to radiologically implanted catheter. In fact, these shortcomings of radiological procedure may be overcome by introducing modified techniques (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). First, the rate of catheter displacement could be reduced to less than 5% by "tip-fix‚Äù technique (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In addition, under the guidance of DSA, extrahepatic branches can be accurately identified and embolized so as to reduce complications related to extrahepatic infusion (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In addition, radiological implantation is performed under local anesthesia with minimal trauma, which allows the planned HAI and SCT to start immediately. This is a notable advantage over surgical procedure, especially for patients with progressive disease in the liver.
