<p>HAI pump system (Celsite, B. Braun, Chasseneuil, France) was implanted under digital subtraction angiography (DSA) guidance using "side-hole” and "tip-fixation” technology as previously described (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The extrahepatic branches such as the right gastric artery and the dorsal pancreatic artery were embolized to prevent extrahepatic perfusion. When multiple arteries are involved in the liver blood supply, the catheter is placed in the dominant artery, and the non-dominant branches are embolized to ensure whole hepatic infusion.
