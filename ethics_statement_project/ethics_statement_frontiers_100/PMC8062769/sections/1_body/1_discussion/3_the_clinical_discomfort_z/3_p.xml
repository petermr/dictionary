<p>McCann et al. (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) recognized that the assessment of sexuality is often neglected by mental health clinicians while acknowledging the challenges of institutionalization, risk, stigma, communication, and clinical setting. Urry et al. (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) concluded that mental health clinicians often omit the assessment of their patient's sexual health as it is a "peripheral issue” and "not pragmatic to bring up sexual health.”
