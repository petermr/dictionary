<p>SCC in the presence of DD is rarely reported as well as in the presence of Ledderhose disease, Garrod knuckle pads, and Peyronie's disease which share common predisposing factors, comorbidities, pathophysiology, and evolution with DD (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The two reported cases are mentioned above. To our knowledge, there are no reports of SCC in the presence of Garrod knuckle pads and Peyronie's disease, and this is the first case in the English literature of SCC on the palm of a patients with DD. It is postulated that chronic inflammation/wound and scarring in DD may be the cause of SCC.
