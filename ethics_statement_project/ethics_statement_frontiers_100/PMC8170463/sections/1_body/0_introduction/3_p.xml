<p>While cross-sectional insights have provided a snapshot of the acute impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Australians mental health, little is currently known about the mental health impact emerging from the consecutive community threats that presented across 2019/2020 with reference to pre-disaster data. For example, is any increase in expression of depressive or anxiety symptoms attributed to COVID-19 greater than that experienced during other disasters, and how does it compare to regular yearly fluctuations that occur across seasons? To better capture the incidence of mental health issues in the general community, 
 <xref rid="ref155" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al. (2020)</xref> recommend going beyond traditional health department data sets, and utilizing ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodologies, also known as Experience-Sampling-Methods (ESM), to provide a dynamic picture of health and behavior. These assessment protocols allow sampling of participants' experiences in real-time for extended periods, and overcome retrospective biases of survey research (such as mood congruency and recency effects) by accessing emotional reports as they occur. Monitoring population mental health and well-being is critical to understanding how communities respond to emergencies, their trajectories of recovery, and to better tailor opportunities for support and intervention. Smartphone dissemination of EMA intensive surveying may provide the high temporal resolution required during a pandemic and a useful avenue for ongoing public mental health surveillance. Inclusion of positive functioning indices has also been recommended to provide insight into resilience during the pandemic (
