<p>Australia's entry into the COVID-19 pandemic was distinct from the rest of the world. Bushfires had impacted the eastern coast continuously for 19 weeks, with over 18.6 million hectares of land burnt, 28 fatalities, and over 1 billion livestock and wildlife killed. In addition to the immediate threat of fire to communities, the air quality across the eastern seaboard deteriorated, hitting hazardous levels for several days. The damage caused by particulate matter on respiratory health was estimated to be responsible for 417 additional deaths, 1,124 hospitalisations, and 1,305 asthma cases that required attendance at emergency departments (

Taken together, the eastern states of Australia were already in a state of emergency and had been responding to public health concerns on a mass scale for a sustained period. The impact of COVID-19 on Australians must, therefore, also be considered in the context of this previous public health threat, rather than in isolation.
