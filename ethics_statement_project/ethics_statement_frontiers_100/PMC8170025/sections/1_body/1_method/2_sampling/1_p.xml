<p>In the English corpus, we selected “pride” and “proud” along with their grammatical variations, including “prided,” “prides,” “priding,” “prouder,” and “proudest” (Apresjan, 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In the Chinese corpus, we selected “自豪,” “自大,” and “骄傲,” which are Chinese synonyms for “pride” and “proud.” These words were used as search keywords. For each keyword found in the corpora, the search returned the text that included 20 Chinese characters or punctuations before each keyword and 20 Chinese characters or punctuations after each keyword in the Chinese corpus, and 15 words or punctuations on each side of the keyword in the English corpus. These strings of texts were considered as items. On occasions when multiple keywords were contained in the same item, they were treated either as a single occurrence when multiple occurrences were about the same type of pride or as separate occurrences when they were about different types of pride. We identified 10,909 and 10,542 items in the blog and news genres of COCA, respectively, and the corresponding numbers of items were 42,502 and 45,675 in the BCC. From these items, we randomly selected about 1,500 items from each type of items (1,533 English blog items, 1,462 English news items, 1,512 Chinese blog items, and 1,574 Chinese news items; the minor variations were due to an effort to ensure that the distribution of the various keywords in the final selection was the same as that for the corpora). In sum, we included 2,995 items from COCA and 3,086 items from BCC.
