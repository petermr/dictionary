<p>Another limitation of the existing research on cultural differences in pride is its lack of differentiation of collective pride. Recent research has indicated that collective pride should be divided into relational pride and national pride (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; White and Branscombe, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Relational pride concerns one's family, friends, and township (e.g., “When your friends achieve success” and “When your hometown is praised”). In contrast, national pride is tied to national achievements (e.g., “When a Chinese scientist receives the Nobel Prize”) (van Hilvoorde et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Kavetsos, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Meier and Mutz, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Some studies have focused on national pride (Hjerm, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Evans and Kelly, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Smith and Kim, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), but they have not considered individual pride and relational pride.
