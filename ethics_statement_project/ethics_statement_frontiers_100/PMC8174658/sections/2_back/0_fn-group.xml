  <p>Excerpt from workers' instructions: "There are two types of players in this experiment, employers and workers. You have been randomly selected to be a worker” and "A third participant has been randomly chosen to be an employer.” "You and the other worker are invited to work individually on a task on behalf of the employer.” See

  <p>In

This table shows some workers (only four in total) chose to refrain from providing effort, and these workers all participated in treatments where effort was not observed by the employer.
