<p>There were two types of players in the experiment, namely workers and employers. The workers labored individually in pairings on behalf of the employer on a real effort task. For each worker, a random draw made by the computer determined the worker’s output from the working period. This was done after the working period ended so that the workers did not know their output before they started working. After the output was drawn, the output was converted into real money and added to the money from the other worker in the pairing. This sum was transferred to the employer, who was tasked with distributing two-thirds of the money between the two workers while keeping the last third for themselves. We explain below what information the employer had when making the distribution. The complete set of instructions can be found in
