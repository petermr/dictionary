<p>The working period lasted for 20 min. The real effort task involved decoding a random string of 10 letters into a sequence of 10 numbers using a code sheet that listed the letters and their numbers. All numbers had to be correct in order to move to the next string, and there was an infinite number of strings for the worker to decode. Workers could decide the amount of effort they wanted to put in and decode as many or as few strings as they wanted. We used the number of strings a worker decoded as a measure of that worker’s effort.
