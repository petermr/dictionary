<p>If effort is believed to be positively correlated with performance, and if high levels of noise (i.e., random variation) are compensated by high-powered incentives like tournament theory predicts (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Lazear and Rosen, 1981</xref>), then people work hard even in a noisy environment where luck is important. However, what if the workers know their effort does not help performance? Will they still work hard? We investigated this question in a laboratory experiment by assessing under which conditions workers are willing to manifest effort, even if output (and thus the employer's earnings) is determined by pure luck. We varied whether the employer, who rewarded the workers, can observe the workers' effort, and whether the employer knows that earnings were determined by luck.
