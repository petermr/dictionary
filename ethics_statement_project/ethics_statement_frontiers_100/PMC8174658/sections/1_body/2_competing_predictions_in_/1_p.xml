<p>Our first two hypotheses outline that both "inward-focused” deontological ethics and "outward focused” virtue ethics may motivate effort in a game of luck and that virtue ethics would provide the most powerful motivation. However, it is less obvious whether employees will work hard if the role of luck is common knowledge (i.e., when both the employer and the workers know that effort is unrelated to earnings). Under these conditions, it is possible to argue for competing predictions with regards to worker's beliefs and consequent effort. On the one hand, a worker may believe the employer will be unimpressed with explicitly unproductive efforts. If this is the case, the worker may assume higher efforts will fail to elicit higher compensation from the employer. The worker may even suspect the employer will punish unproductive efforts and provide lower compensation for higher efforts, as the employer may view it as their job to correct misguided behavior through reductions in compensation. On the other hand, it is conceivable that workers will rely on a commonly held work ethic heuristic (see 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kruger et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Schrift et al., 2016</xref>) in which even explicitly unproductive efforts will be rewarded by the employer. Past research has demonstrated the link between effort and judgments about moral virtue is unrelated to outcomes (

However, this effect has never been tested in a setting in which the lack of a relationship between effort and earnings is common knowledge. As a result, we hypothesize that workers will rely on the work ethic heuristic and expect that high effort will be rewarded, even when it is common knowledge that effort does not help performance. Therefore, we formulated our third hypothesis:
