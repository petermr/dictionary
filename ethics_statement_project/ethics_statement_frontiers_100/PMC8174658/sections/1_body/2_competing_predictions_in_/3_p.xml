<p>Lastly, we investigated the role of potential "undeserved rewards” in workers' effort provisions. When effort is unobservable and the role of effort and luck is not known by the employers, workers may worry about being given "undeserved rewards” (i.e., rewards that the worker believes would not have been given if the employer had been informed about the lack of correlation between effort and luck). It is natural for the worker to believe that the employer, without receiving any prior information, would assume that whatever earnings are produced will at least be partly related to the worker's effort level. If the earnings are substantial, it is natural for the worker to expect a substantial reward. This setting may be uncomfortable to some workers, who may feel negatively about being rewarded for earnings they did not cause. In this case, a form of inaction aversion could materialize (see 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson, 2003</xref>) whereby workers work hard as a way to avoid the negative feeling of being rewarded for something they did not earn. Having exerted effort, even if it was unproductive, may make the reward more palatable to the employee. This leads to our fourth hypothesis:
