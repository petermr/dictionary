<p>This paper presents results from a controlled lab experiment investigating under which conditions workers were willing to put in effort, even if output (and thus employer's earnings) was determined by pure luck. We varied whether the employer could observe the workers' effort, as well as whether the employer knew that earnings were determined by luck. Standard economic theory predicts that workers would not exert effort in any of the conditions we investigated. However, we propose a form of moral psychology can explain when and why people will exert effort in a game of pure luck, namely deontological ethics (whereby the moral value of an action is judged on the basis of rules, duties, and obligations) and virtue ethics (in which the individual, not the action, is the unit of moral evaluation).</p>
