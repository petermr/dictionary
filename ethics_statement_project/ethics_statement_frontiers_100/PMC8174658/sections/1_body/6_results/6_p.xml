<p>Another observation, which was also consistent with the workers' beliefs presented above, is that employers' knowledge about the role of luck did not affect effort provision at all, as effort was observable. In 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, mean effort in EOLK was 59.24, while it was 58.43 in EOLU. This difference is not significant (Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic>-test, 
 <italic>z</italic> = 0.21, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.84). Hence, even when the employer was informed that effort was unproductive (in the sense of not affecting earnings), workers still provided as much effort as when the employer only observed effort and did not know that the effort was unrelated to earnings. One interpretation of this finding is that effort provision is used as an important signaling device, informing the employer that the worker is deserving and a virtuous worker.
