<p>Regression results are found in 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. As indicated in model 3, 
 <italic>Grade</italic> is positive and significant, showing workers with better grades tended to exert more effort, while 
 <italic>Age</italic> is insignificant. More interesting are the dummy variables determining our treatments in model 1. 
 <italic>Effort observed</italic> is positive and significant, demonstrating that workers exert significantly more effort when effort is observable by the employer. The coefficient for 
 <italic>Effort observed</italic> alone gives the comparison of EOLK and EULK, while combining all coefficients (10.27 + 4.85 âˆ’ 5.65 = 9.47) gives the comparison of EOLU versus EULK.

 </sup> Thus, controlling for worker's age and academic performance, the regressions in 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> support the results from the previously presented non-parametric tests: workers worked harder if the employer could observe their unproductive effort.
