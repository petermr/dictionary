 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> supports the observations explained above. Using Mann-Whitney U-tests, we found that workers believed the employer would reward effort when effort was observable to the employer but not when effort was unobservable. Importantly, results suggest that when effort was observed by the employer, workers' beliefs were insensitive to employers' knowledge about the role of luck, as shown by the insignificant difference between EOLK and EOLU. Although the majority of workers believed that effort would not be rewarded in EULK and EULU, the workers tended to be more confident if the employer had knowledge about the role of luck compared to when the employer was uninformed about the role of luck. This finding is highlighted in rows 3 and 5 in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, as more workers believed the employer would not reward effort in EULK compared to EULU. Also, the difference in responses was significant between EULK and EULU, as noted in 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>.
