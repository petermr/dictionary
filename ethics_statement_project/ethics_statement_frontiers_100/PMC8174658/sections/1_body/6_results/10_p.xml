<p>Neither 
 <italic>Luck unknown</italic> nor the interaction variable is significant, indicating that the employer's knowledge about the role of luck was of less importance for workers when they had decided their effort provision. However, as indicated by 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, male and female workers could differ in their response to whether the employer knew it was a game of luck. In 
 <xref rid="T7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>, we investigate this further and present OLS regressions for male and female workers separately. Focusing on male workers first (model 5 and model 7), we see from the insignificant coefficient 
 <italic>Luck unknown</italic> that no difference in effort provision existed between EULK and EULU. This was true when effort was observed and when we compare the two treatments with and without employer knowledge about the role of luck [EOLK≈59 and EOLU≈63, Wald test: 
 <italic>F</italic>(1, 99) = 0.28, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.60]. We also look at how effort observability affected male workers. As indicated by the coefficient 
 <italic>Effort observed</italic>, the difference between EOLK and EULK is not significant. However, comparing the two treatments where effort was observed by the employer with the two treatments where effort was not observed by the employer yields a positive and significant effect [Wald test: 
 <italic>F</italic>(1, 99) = 4.55, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.04].
