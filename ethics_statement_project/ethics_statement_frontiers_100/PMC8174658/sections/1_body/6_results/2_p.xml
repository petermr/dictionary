 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> presents participant responses to the following statement: "The employer will give the most money to the worker who has solved the most decoding tasks during the working period.” First, when the employer could observe effort, the majority of workers believed that effort would be rewarded. This was true irrespective of whether the employer was informed about the role of luck. By looking at the combination of columns 5 and 6 in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, we find no significant differences in the frequency of subjects who believe that effort will be rewarded (or who are sure that effort will be rewarded), comparing EOLK (59.3%) and EOLU (64.3%) (test of equal proportions, 
 <italic>z</italic> = −0.55, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.58). In the two treatments where effort was not observable by the employer, the majority of subjects correctly believed the employer would not reward effort. According to row 3 and row 5 in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, 93% (EULK) and 89% (EULU) of the subjects were neutral, did not believe effort would be rewarded, or were sure that effort would not be rewarded, respectively. While the responses in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> for EULK and EULU indicate most workers understood that the employer cannot be affected by effort when deciding worker earnings, four workers in EULK and seven workers in EULU still indicated that they believed effort would be rewarded by the employer.
