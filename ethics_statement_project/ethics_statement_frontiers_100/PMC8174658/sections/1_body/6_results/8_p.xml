<p>We ran a regression analysis to check the robustness of the results from the non-parametric test. Also, as noted in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the data regarding both gender and the subjects' grades were not perfectly balanced.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="footnote5">5</xref>
 </sup> Thus, in the following regression analysis, we include the following: 
 <italic>Age</italic>, which is a continuous variable measuring the subject's age; 
 <italic>Female</italic>, which is an indicator variable for participant gender; and 
 <italic>Grade</italic>, which is an ordinal variable measuring self-reported average grade, ranging from 0 (= F) to 5 (= A). To indicate different treatments, we used two dummy variables: 
 <italic>Effort observed</italic> is equal to one if the employer could observe the worker's effort and is zero otherwise. 
 <italic>Luck unknown</italic> is a dummy variable equal to one if the role of luck was unknown to the employer and is zero otherwise. Lastly, we include the interaction variable 
 <italic>Effort observed 
  <sup>âˆ—</sup> Luck unknown
 </italic>. This interaction variable alone presents the difference-in-difference coefficient for our treatments (i.e., the difference in effort between EOLK and EULK and between EOLU and EULU). The reference group in our models consists of the condition where effort was unobserved by the employer but the employer was aware that workers were participating in a game of luck (EULK).
