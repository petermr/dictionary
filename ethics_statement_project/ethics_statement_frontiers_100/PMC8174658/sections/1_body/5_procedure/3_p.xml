<p>There was only one employer in each session. This employer was asked to distribute the money between the two workers for all the pairs in that session. We decided to have only one employer in each session because the workers’ behavior was our primary interest. We did not communicate to the workers that one employer was responsible for all the pairs,

 </sup> only that they worked for a participant who was randomly selected to be an employer. When distributing the money, the employer saw the sums of money the workers had generated and, depending on the treatment, the number of strings each worker had decoded. The employer could not take money from one pair and distribute it to another pair; the whole amount of the two-thirds from the pair had to be distributed between the two workers in that particular pair for the computer to accept the distribution. After the employer had made all the distributions, the computer randomly selected one pair from which the employer received payment. The sessions lasted approximately 50 min, and the average payment was approximately NOK 230 (aprox 23 Euros).
