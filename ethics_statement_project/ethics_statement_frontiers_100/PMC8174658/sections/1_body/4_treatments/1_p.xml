<p>The workers always observed their own effort and were told that output was random. Workers were also informed about what information the employer received prior to the working period. Treatment variations were based on what information the employer had available when distributing the reward. The employer always viewed the individual worker’s output when making the distribution but knew only in two of the treatments that the output came from a random draw made by the computer. This allowed us to test the effect of both an informed and uninformed employer on workers’ effort. The other aspect we investigated was the effect of effort being observable. Therefore, we implemented two treatments in which the employer saw the individual worker’s effort and two treatments in which the employer did not see effort.
