<p>Machiavellianism is a value system that regards human nature as inherently evil, which is similar to “Thick Face, Black Heart” or 
 <italic>Houhei</italic> in Chinese (Tang and Guo, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Furthermore, high 
 <italic>Houhei</italic> always pretend to be kind people, but they use moral rules to restrain others in order to fight for their own interests. Machiavellianism represents a different set of values within our awareness that co-exists with the ethical values that we currently advocate and practice in Chinese society, which regard human nature as inherently good. Machiavellianism includes tendencies to maximize personal interests and to use other people as tools to achieve their goals (Karkoulian et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Demirta and Biçkes, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Czibor et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Individuals with higher levels of Machiavellianism are more likely to act contrary to ethics (Karkoulian et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Jones and Paulhus, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Elias, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). They may exhibit unethical behaviors such as exaggeration of their performance and causing social harm to colleagues (Greenbaum et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Thus, based on this empirical evidence, we hypothesize: The higher an individual's level of Machiavellianism, the higher their anxiety will be when confronted with a dilemma (H1).
