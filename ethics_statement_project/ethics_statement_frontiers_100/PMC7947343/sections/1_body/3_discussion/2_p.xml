<p>Our findings are consistent with those of previous studies. For example, Rokeach and Ball-Rokeach (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>) suggested that if an individual's value system is in conflict, that person would experience a decrease in self-satisfaction. Burroughs and Rindfleisch (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) believed that major conflicts arise more easily between two fundamentally opposing values, and that such conflicts will cause psychological tension in the individual, which in turn reduces their sense of well-being. Xu (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) also reported that there is an "interdependence” between Confucianism and Machiavellianism. The correlation between Confucian concepts and impulsive tendencies was mediated by "thick black” concepts and behaviors, while the correlation between Machiavellianism and impulsive tendencies was mediated by Confucian concepts and behaviors (Xu, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).
