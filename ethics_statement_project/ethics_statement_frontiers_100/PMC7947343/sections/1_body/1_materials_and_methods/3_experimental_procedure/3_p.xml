<p>The second phase involved administering a different test packet; in this phase, participants were informed that this was part of an investigation of human relationships within the university.

For the first question, "When facing such a scenario, what decision would you have made in the end?” the participants were required to choose one of two pre-set answers.

The first question was designed to encourage participants to think closely about the scenarios, as well as to prompt deeper reflection and processing of the presented scenarios. The participants' answers were not used in the statistical analyses. The crucial data (dependent variable) for the study were the scores from the second question (the STAI scores for each of the five dilemmas combined, so that each participant received only one STAI score).</p>
