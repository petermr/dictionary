<p>Using a free-text comment box, 12 experts provided comments and confirmed the described challenges in identifying IS literature. Using content analysis, we developed three categories: (1) A plethora of terms used for IS: "IS articles are highly variable […] depending on how one interprets IS (even within the context of the Mittman and Eccles definition) […] It is really soiled, and even articles that appear as IS are sometimes (or even often) not really IS (i.e., way outside the conceptualization of IS, such as only focusing on implementing something vs. studying the implementation of it)” (#3; Other). (2) Methodological overlap of IS with other fields of research and scattering of IS evidence across disciplines: "There are hundreds [refers to journals; author's note] as in my experience implementation-relevant work is now being published in almost every field […]. IS is very much an integrative field” (#1; Other). (3) Individual considerations to access relevant IS literature: "So for me it depends on the field of research: for my area, I would add the specific journals that I know where such research is published, although it might be only 2-3 articles per year” (#10; Other).</p>
