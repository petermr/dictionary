<p>Accessing and synthesizing available evidence is an essential first step in research and required to successfully bridge the gap between research and real-world settings. However, challenges to the identification of available IS evidence were already being reported a decade ago and continue to cause avoidable research waste (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). To ensure effective retrieval and reproducibility of searches, a search strategy should entail all relevant search terms for a concept to be studied—both text words and MeSH terms—that can be combined using Boolean operators. Further validated filters can be applied to support finer targeting. Previous studies about IS search filters provide an overview of relevant terms to build up search strings to identify various types of implementation research (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In addition, the recent introduction of "implementation science” as a MeSH term for PubMed searches will certainly support researchers' literature searches.
