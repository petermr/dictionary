<p>First, we assessed the perceived relevance of journals identified in a literature search for INSPECT (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). An extensive search string was developed, using text words and MeSH terms referring to IS (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Almost 11,000 hits (
 <italic>N</italic> = 10,904) were identified, published in 2,461 various journals. We selected the 12 journals most commonly identified (more than 60 times), which represent 31.4% of all hits. Experts could rate the relevance of each journal on a 4-point Likert scale. Perception responses ranged from 1 ("not at all”) to 4 ("definitely”), with 5 signifying "journal not known.” Perception scores were dichotomized as either "relevant” (ratings of 3 or 4) or "not relevant” (ratings of 1 or 2); ratings of 5 were set as missing. Next, experts were invited to indicate any other journals they deemed important for the identification of IS articles. Finally, demographic characteristics including country of residence, field of research, and years of experience in implementation research were gathered.
