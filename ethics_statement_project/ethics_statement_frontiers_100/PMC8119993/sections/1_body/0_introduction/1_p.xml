<p>Bridging the gap between research and practice using scientific methods is the central aim of implementation science (IS) which can be defined as the “scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence-based practices into routine practice, and, hence, to improve the quality and effectiveness of health services and care” (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). IS studies typically require an expansive cross-disciplinary understanding of relevant empirical findings and of whether and where they have been implemented. To ensure that research is novel, necessary, and attentive to existing work, each research project should begin with a search of relevant IS literature (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, this search process is hampered by a lack of unified definitions and conceptualizations, as well as by suboptimal indexing: a plethora of terms are used across disciplines, varying over time and geography (e.g., dissemination and implementation science, knowledge translation, research utilization) (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). This lack of consistency applies not only to terminology, but also to the definition of IS itself (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In addition, some aspects of the IS methodology overlap with methods from other fields, all of which have their own specific language and labeling (e.g., improvement science) (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). This results in heterogeneity and inconsistencies in operationalization challenge the development of precise search strings, thereby impacting the identification of relevant literature (
