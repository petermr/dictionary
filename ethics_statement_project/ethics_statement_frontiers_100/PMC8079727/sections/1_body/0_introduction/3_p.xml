<p>In this prospective randomized trinational study, the first primary endpoint was "How long (in days) does it take until no attacks of spinning vertigo can be induced?” In this way, the effects of repeated maneuvers (three in the morning, three at noon, and three in the evening) were evaluated, with the first and second maneuvers done by the physician and the subsequent maneuvers performed by the patient—after careful instruction—as self-treatment maneuvers. This treatment regime was chosen because it reflects real world clinical practice. Further, this approach of evaluating not only the effects of a single maneuver is supported by a recent study evaluating the optimal reassessment time for treatment response in pc-BPPV (
