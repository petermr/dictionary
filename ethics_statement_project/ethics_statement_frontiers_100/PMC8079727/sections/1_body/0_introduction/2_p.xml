<p>Based on our biophysical model of BPPV (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), we hypothesized that the new "SémontPLUS maneuver” (SM+) is more effective than SM because this model shows that the more the affected canal is tilted toward the affected side during the movement of the head toward the affected side, the further the otoconia move toward the exit of the posterior canal (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This also predicts that more otoconia should then move beyond the vertex of the canal when the patient is subsequently moved toward the unaffected side (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). It should thus increase the effectivity of the maneuver.
