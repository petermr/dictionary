<p>Two primary endpoints were chosen to evaluate two questions: (1) the long-term effect of SM vs. SM+, i.e., the “real world recovery” for the patient and (2) the short-term effect of a single SM vs. SM+ because of the wide range of reported efficacy of single treatment maneuvers in the literature (see 
 <bold>Introduction</bold>).
