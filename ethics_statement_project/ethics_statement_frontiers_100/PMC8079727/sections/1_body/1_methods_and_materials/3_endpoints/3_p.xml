<p>The second primary endpoint is the success rate of a single liberatory maneuver, i.e., either SM or SM+, on the occurrence of vertigo and/or positional nystagmus, tested after the first SM or SM+ (“yes” or “no”). If neither spinning vertigo nor nystagmus was induced in the diagnostic maneuver, the liberatory maneuver was rated as primarily successful. If vertigo and/or nystagmus were detected, it was rated as primarily unsuccessful.</p>
