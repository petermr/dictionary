  <bold>Objective:</bold> To compare the efficacy of the Sémont maneuver (SM) with the new “SémontPLUS maneuver” (SM+) in patients with posterior canal BPPV canalolithiasis (pcBPPVcan).
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Methods and Patients:</bold> In a prospective trinational (Germany, Italy, and Belgium) randomized trial, patients with pcBPPVcan were randomly assigned to SM or SM+; SM+ means overextension of the head by 60+° below earth horizontal line during the movement of the patient toward the affected side. The first maneuver was done by the physician, and the subsequent maneuvers by the patients 9 times/day on their own. Each morning the patient documented whether vertigo could be induced. The primary endpoints were: “How long (in days) does it take until no attacks can be induced?” and “What is the efficacy of a single SM/SM+?”
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Results:</bold> In the 194 patients analyzed (96 SM, 98 SM+), it took 2 days (median, range 1–21 days, mean 3.6 days) for recovery with SM and 1 day (median, range 1-8 days, mean 1.8 days) with SM+ (

  <italic>U</italic>-test). There was no difference in the second primary endpoint (chi
  <sup>2</sup>-test, 
  <italic>p</italic> = 0.39).
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Interpretation:</bold> This prospective trial shows that SM+ is more effective than SM when repeated therapeutic maneuvers are performed but not when a single maneuver is performed. It also supports the hypothesis of the biophysical model: overextension of the head during step 2 brings the clot of otoconia beyond the vertex of the canal, which increases the effectivity.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Classification of Evidence:</bold> This study provides Class I evidence that SM+ is superior to SM for multiple treatment maneuvers of pcBPPVcan.
