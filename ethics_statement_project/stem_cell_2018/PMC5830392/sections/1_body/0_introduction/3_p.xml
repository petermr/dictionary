<p>In a phase I/II study of RIC we documented that bort-based GvHD prophylaxis (bort 1.3 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> IV on d +1, +4, +7, plus conventional tacrolimus [tax] and methotrexate [mtx]) was safe and potentially efficacious in T-replete HLA-mismatched donor (MMD) transplantation, with survival comparable to HLA-matched cohorts.

 </sup> These data were used to support the inclusion of the bort-based regimen as one novel arm of an ongoing multicenter phase II randomized trial, comparing it to two other novel regimens: post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy), and maraviroc, each compared to a non-randomized 'conventional care' cohort (The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network [BMTCTN] 1203).
