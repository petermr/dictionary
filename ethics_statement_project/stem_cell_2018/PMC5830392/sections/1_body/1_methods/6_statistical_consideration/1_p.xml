<p>The primary endpoint was a grade II-IV aGvHD rate by day 180 after stem cell infusion. Secondary endpoints included cumulative incidence of aGvHD, NRM, relapse, chronic (c)GvHD, and PFS, OS and GvHD-free/relapse-free survival (GRFS). The study was designed for the primary comparisons of the grade II-IV aGvHD rates in arm A 
 <italic>vs</italic>. B and arm A 
 <italic>vs</italic>. C in parallel. We projected the incidence of grade II-IV aGvHD as 40% in arm A and 15% in arm B and in arm C. With the sample size of 46 per arm, there is an 80% power to detect a 25% difference in grade II-IV aGvHD rate between two arms. This power calculation is based on Fisher’s exact test at one-sided type I error rate of 0.05. The primary analysis was performed per the modified intent-to-treat principle (mITT), i.e., all patients who were randomized and received any amount of the study treatment were included in the primary analysis. Cumulative incidence of aGvHD and cGvHD, relapse and NRM were estimated in the competing risk framework. Relapse with or without death was considered a competing risk for NRM, and similarly NRM for relapse. Death or relapse without developing GvHD was a competing event for GvHD. GvHD incidences occurring after relapse, in the setting of relapse interventions (e.g., immunosuppression [IS] taper, donor lymphocyte infusion [DLI]), were counted in the estimation of cumulative incidence of GvHD in order to obtain comprehensive estimates, and both inclusive and exclusive estimates are presented for aGvHD endpoints. GRFS, PFS and OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. GRFS was defined as the time from stem cell infusion to incidence of grade III/IV aGvHD, cGvHD requiring systemic immunosuppression agents, relapse or death, whichever occured first. PFS and OS have been defined elsewhere. Cumulative incidences in the presence of competing events were compared using the Gray test, and Kaplan-Meier estimates were compared using the log-rank test.

 </sup> For time-to-event endpoints, 
 <italic>P</italic>-values reflect comparing entire distributions along with point estimates for ease of presentation. For the primary endpoint, incidence rates of grade II-IV aGvHD by day +180 were compared at one-sided significance level of 0.05 using Fisher’s exact test; 
 <italic>P</italic>-values for secondary endpoints are two-sided at the significance level of 0.05, without adjusting for multiple comparisons. Multivariable analysis adjusting for variables, as listed in 
 <xref rid="t1-1030522" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, were performed for OS and PFS using a Cox model, and a Fine and Gray model was used for grade II-IV aGvHD.

 </sup> Immunophenotype data were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test at each time point without adjusting for multiple comparisons. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and R version 3.1.3 (the CRAN project).
