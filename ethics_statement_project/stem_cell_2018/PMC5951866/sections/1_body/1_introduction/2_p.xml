<p id="Par7">Due to the risk of cardiotoxicity with increasing cumulative anthracycline dose, repeated use of anthracyclines is limited in patients with relapsed/refractory disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Newer agents are few, and include ibrutinib for relapsed/refractory mantle-cell lymphoma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and idelalisib for refractory follicular lymphoma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Pixantrone, an agent that belongs to the aza-anthracenedione family [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], is a recommended option in multiply relapsed and refractory disease or heavily pretreated patients with NHL [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Pixantrone’s molecular structure is different from anthracyclines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The differences in its structure result in a unique mechanism of action, notably with a lesser potential for iron binding and therefore less cardiotoxicity compared with anthracyclines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].
