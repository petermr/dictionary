<p id="Par8">Pixantrone has conditional approval in Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], based on results from the open-label, randomized phase 3 PIX301 study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], where significantly more patients who received pixantrone than comparator (physician’s choice of treatment) achieved a complete (CR) or an unconfirmed complete response (CRu) and a higher overall response rate (ORR) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; median PFS was also significantly prolonged in the pixantrone arm. It is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell NHL [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. To complete post-authorization measures, a confirmatory phase 3 study (PIX306) is underway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Study recruitment is complete and results from the primary efficacy endpoint analysis are expected in 2018.
