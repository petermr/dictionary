<p>During days 1–5 (0–120 h), each patient completed a diary, capturing emetic episodes, severity of nausea and rescue medications intake. An emetic episode was defined as any episode of vomiting or retching or combined vomiting/retching. Severity of nausea was evaluated using a 100-mm horizontal visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 'no nausea' (0 mm) to 'nausea as bad as it could be' (100 mm). The Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE) questionnaire [nine nausea-specific (nausea domain) and nine vomiting-specific (vomiting domain) items] was used to assess the impact of CINV on patient's daily life. Responses were marked on a 100-mm VAS with anchors of 1 and 7. Patients completed this questionnaire on days 2 and 6 [
