<p>The primary efficacy endpoint was complete response (CR: no emesis, no rescue medication) during the overall phase. Key secondary efficacy endpoints included CR during the acute/delayed phases and each individual day, and no emesis, no significant nausea (NSN : VAS score &lt;25 mm), no nausea (VAS score &lt; 5 mm), and no rescue medication during the acute, delayed and overall phases. FLIE scores reflecting NIDL during the acute/delayed phases were also evaluated as a secondary 'quality-of-life' endpoint.</p>
