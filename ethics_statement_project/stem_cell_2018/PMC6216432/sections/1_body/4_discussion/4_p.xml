<p>The present results are encouraging as they suggest that beta band spectral power may be used to identify patients that will respond well to the umbilical cord blood treatment. Only baseline posterior beta power, and not theta or alpha power, was associated with clinical improvement. Furthermore, posterior beta power increased significantly in the trial. Beta oscillations have been theorized to serve larger scale communication between sensorimotor regions and distant brain regions

In this study, participants with higher beta power at the onset of the trial demonstrated more improvement than those with lower beta power. Children with ASD with higher beta power may have more skills related to integrating information and adapting to change, thus allowing for greater improvement in complex domains such as socialization and communication.
