<p>The clinical global impression‐improvement (CGI‐I) scale is a commonly used rating scale that measures clinical improvement as baseline 
 <xref rid="sct312347-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">50</xref>. The CGI‐I is a seven‐point scale indicating the degree of improvement or worsening of ASD symptoms relative to baseline. Based on all available information, each participant was rated as 1 = "very much improved”; 2 = "much improved”; 3 = "minimally improved”; 4 = "no change”; 5 = "minimally worse”; 6 = "much worse”; or 7 = "very much worse.” Each participant was assigned a CGI‐I rating at the 6‐ and 12‐month visits, and each referenced the degree of improvement or worsening relative to baseline. Ratings were made by experienced clinicians with expertise in ASD.
