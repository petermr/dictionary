<p>Results from observational studies using EEG have helped to identify spatial and temporal abnormalities in children and adults with ASD as well as infants at risk for ASD. These studies offer potential treatment endpoints. Some of the key findings include disrupted cortical network connectivity

 <xref rid="sct312347-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> described a U‐shaped power profile of ASD characterized by excessive power in low‐frequency (delta, theta) and high‐frequency bands (gamma) and reduced power in a midrange frequency band (alpha, beta), which may result from abnormal GABAergic tone in inhibitory circuits. Furthermore, patterns of spectral power and functional connectivity have been found to be associated with severity of ASD symptoms and specific ASD subtypes
