<p id="Par9">Adverse events (AEs) were graded using the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for AEs, version 4.0. Myeloma disease response was done in accordance with the International Myeloma Working Group uniform criteria, incorporating the additional category of MR. All response categories required confirmation of the required tests with the exception of the bone marrow used for CR determination. At any point in treatment, patients suspected of PD had response assessments repeated to confirm disease progression. If patients did not have confirmation and went on to another treatment, they were classified as having progressive disease.</p>
