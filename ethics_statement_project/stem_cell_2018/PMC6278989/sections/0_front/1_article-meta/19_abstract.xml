 <p>A hallmark of Fanconi anemia is accelerated decline in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (CD34 +) leading to bone marrow failure. Long-term treatment requires hematopoietic cell transplantation from an unaffected donor but is associated with potentially severe side-effects. Gene therapy to correct the genetic defect in the patient's own CD34
  <sup>+</sup> cells has been limited by low CD34
  <sup>+</sup> cell numbers and viability. Here we demonstrate an altered ratio of CD34
  <sup>Hi</sup> to CD34
  <sup>Lo</sup> cells in Fanconi patients relative to healthy donors, with exclusive 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> repopulating ability in only CD34
  <sup>Hi</sup> cells, underscoring a need for novel strategies to preserve limited CD34
  <sup>+</sup> cells. To address this need, we developed a clinical protocol to deplete lineage
  <sup>+</sup>(CD3
  <sup>+</sup>, CD14
  <sup>+</sup>, CD16
  <sup>+</sup> and CD19
  <sup>+</sup>) cells from blood and marrow products. This process depletes &gt;90% of lineage
  <sup>+</sup>cells while retaining ≥60% of the initial CD34
  <sup>+</sup>cell fraction, reduces total nucleated cells by 1–2 logs, and maintains transduction efficiency and cell viability following gene transfer. Importantly, transduced lineage
  <sup>−</sup> cell products engrafted equivalently to that of purified CD34
  <sup>+</sup> cells from the same donor when xenotransplanted at matched CD34
  <sup>+</sup> cell doses. This novel selection strategy has been approved by the regulatory agencies in a gene therapy study for Fanconi anemia patients (
