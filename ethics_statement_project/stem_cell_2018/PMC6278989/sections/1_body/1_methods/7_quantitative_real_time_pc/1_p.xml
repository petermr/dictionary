<p>Vector copy number (VCN) per genome equivalent was assessed by TaqMan 5' nuclease quantitative real-time PCR assay in duplicate reactions with an LV-specific primer/probe combination [forward, 5'-TGAAAGCGAAAGGGAAACCA; reverse, 5'-CCGTGCGCGCTTCAG; probe, 5'-AGCTCTCTC-GACGCAGGACTCGGC (Integrated DNA Technologies; IDT, Coralville, IA, USA)] and in a separate reaction with a Î²-globin-specific primer/probe combination [forward, 5'-CCTATCA-GAAAGTGGTGGCTGG; reverse, 5'-TTGGACAGCAA-GAAAGTGAGCTT; probe, 5'-TGGCTAATGCCCTGGCCCA-CAAGTA (IDT)]. Two standard curves were established by serial dilution of gDNA isolated from a human cell line (HT1080) confirmed to contain a single integrant of the same LV backbone and from peripheral leukocytes collected from a healthy donor using both primer-probe sets independently.</p>
