<p>Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare monogenic disease with a wide array and variable presence of clinical symptoms, the hallmark of which is bone marrow (BM) failure.

 </sup> The genetic basis of FA is a mutation in any one of 21 genes

 </sup> whose protein components make up the FA/breast cancer pathway responsible for DNA repair of inter-strand crosslinks through nucleotide excision followed by homologous recombination. Resulting compromises in genetic integrity are associated with a nearly uniform decline in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), a 50% incidence of myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia by adolescence, and a 25% lifetime incidence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or gynecological cancer.

 </sup> In some patients, blood cell clones demonstrate spontaneous reversion to wild type (i.e. somatic mosaicism) leading to improved and stable blood cell counts for up to 27 years.

 </sup> Thus, correction of the FA hematopoietic defect could significantly alter the disease’s clinical course, and this has driven decades of research in HSPC gene therapy for FA.
