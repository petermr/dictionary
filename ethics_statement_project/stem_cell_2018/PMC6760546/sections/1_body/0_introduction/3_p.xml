<p id="Par4">The regimen of PTCy for prevention of GvHD was developed in 1999 by St. Johns Hopkin's group in Baltimore [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and had outstanding results with the CIs of 34% grades II-IV and 6% grades III-IV aGvHD by day 200 in Haplo-bone marrow transplantation (Haplo-BMT) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], respectively. Compared with standard PTCy regimen (two doses of PTCy; day +3, +4), one dose of PTCy (day +3) had similar effects in preventing aGvHD, but was less effective for chronic GvHD (cGvHD), especially serious cGvHD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The incidences of viral and fungal infection in Haplo-HSCT with PTCy for GvHD prophylaxis were much lower than ATG-based regimens. Ruggeri et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] retrospectively analyzed the effects of different stem cell source (BM 
 <italic>vs</italic> peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)) on transplant results in Haplo-HSCT with PTCy. The results showed that BM graft was associated with a lower incidence of grades II-IV and grades III-IV acute GVHD (21 
 <italic>vs</italic> 38%, 
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ .01; and 4 
 <italic>vs</italic> 14%, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01, respectively), which was further confirmed by Bashey et al.'s study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These data indicated that PTCy regimen did not have the same effects for GvHD prophylaxis with PBSC graft as compared with BM graft in Haplo-HSCT.
