<p id="Par26">Haploidentical and unrelated cord blood (HID and UCB) are alternative donors for transplant patients without HLA-matched related or unrelated donors. The different combination strategies of haploidentical graft and UCB were successfully used to treat patients with hematological disease. The Spanish's group [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] evaluated another combination strategy of un-manipulated haploidentical stem cells combined with a small dose of umbilical cord blood from a third-party donor (haplo-cord transplant) for hematological malignancies, which was followed by durable haploidentical stem cell engraftment. The results showed that haplo-cord transplant may potentially improve the outcome of HID- and UCB-HSCT alone. To improve the outcomes of haploidentical transplantation, the second combination strategy of un-manipulated haploidentical PBSCs with an UCB (Haplo-PBSCT-Cord) was adopted in our study.
