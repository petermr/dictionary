 </sup>. To test whether the FGF-dependent increase in CSC alters the sensitivity of TNBC cells to chemotherapy, the efficacy of docetaxel was evaluated in M6 cell lines in vitro. Monocultures of M6-Hh cells did not display differential sensitivity to docetaxel when compared to M6-Ctrl cells as expected (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5d</xref>). However, stimulation of M6-Ctrl and M6-Hh models with recombinant FGF5 ligand rescued these cells from docetaxel cytotoxicity (Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). Similar results were observed in the human MDA-MB-231 cell line model of TNBC (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5e</xref>). This result suggests that FGF5, released by Hh-activated CAFs, may create a "chemo-resistant niche” at the tumor−stromal interface of TNBC. It also suggests that targeting both tumor and stromal compartments with chemotherapeutic regimen and SMOi, respectively, may be an effectively therapeutic strategy.
