<p id="Par52">M6 tumors were processed into single-cell suspensions as described previously. Sorted live single epithelial and stromal cells were loaded on a Chromium Single Cell Instrument (10× Genomics, Pleasanton, CA) to generate single-cell Gel Bead-in-Emulsion (GEMs). As per the manufacturer's instructions, approximately ~7000 cells were loaded per channel for a target of ~4000 cells (10× Genomics). Two biological replicates were analyzed per sample. Single-cell RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 30 Gel Bead and Library Kit (10× Genomics). Single-cell sequencing libraries were generated from sorted cells collected in parallel on the same Chromium Single Cell Chip and sequenced in multiplexed pairs to minimize experimental variability and any confounding batch effects. Single-cell libraries were sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq 500 system using the following parameters: pair-end sequencing with dual indexing, 26 cycles for Read1, 8 cycles for I7 Index Read and 98 cycles for Read2.</p>
