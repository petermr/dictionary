<p id="Par55">Gene-sets used in GSEA were extracted from version 3.1 and 4.0 of the Broad Institute’s Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) and extended with additional curated gene-sets from literature. All GSEA analyses were performed using a combined set of the c2, c5 and c6 from MSigDB plus additional curated sets that we identified in the literature.</p>
