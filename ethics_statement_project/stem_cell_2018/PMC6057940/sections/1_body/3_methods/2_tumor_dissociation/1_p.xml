<p id="Par39">M6 tumors were processed into single-cell suspensions before limiting dilution assays, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or flow cytometry analysis. Tumor dissociation into single-cell suspension was carried out using the MACS mouse Tissue Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Australia) in gentleMACS C tubes on the gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. Briefly, up to 1.5 g of tissue was transferred into a gentleMACS C-Tube (Miltenyi Biotec) containing 2.35 mL of RPMI 1640 solution with 1× Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco). 100 μL of enzyme D, 50 μL of enzyme R and 12.5 μL of enzyme A were then added and the sample was processed by running the defined gentleMACS program m_impTumor_02 on the gentleMACS Dissociator. The sample was incubated for 40 min at 37 °C under continuous agitation and then processed using the gentleMACS program m_impTumour_03. The sample was resuspended in RPMI 1640 and filtered sequentially through 70 μm and 40 μm cell strainers (BD Falcon) and the resulting single-cell suspension was centrifuged at 300 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 7 min. Cells were then resuspended in 1× BD Pharm Lyse
 <sup>TM</sup> lysing solution (555899, BD Biosciences) for 3 min at room temperature (RT) to lyse erythrocytes.
