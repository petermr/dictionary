<p id="Par4">More specifically, the Hh developmental pathway is reactivated in a subset of cancers. Binding of Hh ligand to its receptor Patched (PTCH) enables Smoothened (SMO)-mediated translocation of Gli1 into the cell nucleus to drive the transcription of Hh target genes

 </sup>. Mutations in Hh pathway components are oncogenic drivers in “Gorlin’s-like” cancers such as medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma where tumors rely on cell-autonomous Hh signaling

 </sup>. While Hh signaling is quiescent in the adult mammary gland, Hh ligand expression is reactivated in a subset of breast cancers, particularly the poor-prognosis triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. Thirty percent of TNBCs exhibit paracrine Hh pathway signature, defined by high epithelial HH ligand expression in combination with high stromal GLI1 expression, which is associated with a greater risk of metastasis and breast cancer-specific death
