 </sup>, a detailed study of the dynamic crosstalk within the TME is required to make clinical progress in integrating anti-stromal therapies into breast cancer treatment. Progress has been impeded by the field’s limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying tumor−stromal interactions, a limited repertoire of well-tolerated agents to target the TME, and an absence of predictive biomarkers for response to TME-directed therapies. In this study, we showed that CAFs are the primary stromal cells that respond to Hh ligand stimulation. Activated CAFs in turn provide a conducive environment for neoplastic cells to acquire a chemo-resistant stem-like phenotype. SMOi treatment sensitized tumors to docetaxel chemotherapy in mouse models and in patients from the EDALINE Phase I clinical trial, resulting in reduced metastatic burden and improved survival.
