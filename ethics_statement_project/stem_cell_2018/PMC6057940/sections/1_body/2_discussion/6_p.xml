<p id="Par36">Using high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing, we demonstrate that CAFs are the only stromal cell type responding to Hh ligand, and that SMO inhibitors act "on-target” to reverse CAF gene expression changes induced by Hh signaling. Surprisingly, long-term (up to 3 months) daily treatment with SMOi did not alter the stromal cell composition of mammary tumors. This result contrasts markedly to that recently observed in pancreatic, colon and bladder cancer models, where chronic SMO inhibition was associated with marked changes in stromal cellular composition and shorter survival for mice receiving long-term SMOi treatment
