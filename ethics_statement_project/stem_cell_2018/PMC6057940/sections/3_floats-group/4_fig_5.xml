  <p>Hh-activated CAFs form a reversible, chemo-resistant CSC niche via FGF pathway activity. 
   <bold>a</bold> RT-qPCR analysis of 
   <italic>Fgf5</italic> expression in M6 whole tumors. 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3 biological replicates per treatment group with three technical replicates per assay. Statistical significance was determined using unpaired two-tailed Student's 
   <italic>t</italic> test with equal s.d. 
   <bold>b</bold> Expression of 
   <italic>Fgf5</italic> at single-cell resolution in M6 tumor models. Freshly isolated M6-Ctrl (blue), M6-Hh (magenta), and M6-Hh tumors + SMOi (100 mg/kg/bid; violin dots) were captured using 10x Chromium technology. 
   <italic>t</italic>-SNE plot represents the subcellular clusters present in the breast TME of M6 tumors. A sole subset of Hh-activated CAFs exhibits robust expression of 
   <italic>Fgf5</italic> in M6-Hh tumors. 
   <bold>c</bold> Representative immunohistochemistry staining for phospho-FGFR on M6 tumors. Scale bars: 100 μm. Quantification of phospho-FGFR-positive cancer cells at the tumor−stromal interface. 
   <italic>n</italic> = 4 biological replicates per treatment group; statistical significance was determined using unpaired two-tailed Student's 
   <italic>t</italic> test with equal s.d. 
   <bold>d</bold> Relative mRNA expression of CSC markers 
   <italic>Id3</italic> and 
   <italic>Sox10</italic> in M6-Ctrl cells treated with DMSO (vehicle; blue) or recombinant FGF5 (red) in vitro
   <italic>. n</italic> = 3 biological replicates with three technical replicates per experiment; statistical significance was determined using unpaired two-tailed Student's 
   <italic>t</italic> test. 
   <bold>e</bold> Primary and secondary tumorsphere formation of M6-Ctrl cells treated with DMSO (vehicle; blue) or recombinant FGF5 (red). Sphere Formation Efficiency (SFE) values in % are mean ± s.e.m.; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3 biological replicates with three technical replicates per tumorsphere assay. Representative phase contrast micrographs of M6-Ctrl spheres upon recombinant FGF5 stimulation. Scale bars: 100 μm. 
   <bold>f</bold> Cell viability of M6-Ctrl and M6-Hh cells treated with indicated agents (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5 biological replicates with six technical replicates each). Statistical significance was determined using unpaired two-tailed Student's 
   <italic>t</italic> test with equal s.d.; *
