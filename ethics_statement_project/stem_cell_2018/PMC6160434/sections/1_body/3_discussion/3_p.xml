<p id="Par23">This single arm Phase II study was initiated following completion of a Phase I trial in relapsed NB. Despite several limitations, contemporaneous controls have been successfully used to evaluate the results of previous high risk neuroblastoma clinical trials

 </sup>. Therefore to evaluate comparable subjects, we used a subset of subjects enrolled (81% of those on Stratum 1) who immediately prior to enrollment on this study received anti-GD2 immunotherapy while enrolled on the single-arm non-randomized extension of COG ANBL0032. Covariate analysis of population risk variables were matched including time from diagnosis to enrollment on study, initial disease stage,

 </sup>. The median time from start of antibody to start of DFMO was 7.2 months. After statistical correction for this "run in” period, the proportion of ANBL0032 patients remaining event-free for an additional 2 years (the duration of DFMO therapy) is conservatively estimated at 75%, and EFS continues to decrease between 2 and 4 years post therapy. In contrast, the observed two-year EFS for subjects in Stratum 1 who received DFMO after ANBL0032 therapy was 86% ± 4%, and survival curves are stable to 4 years. This suggests there is a clinically significant benefit to maintenance DFMO, justifying further study in a confirmatory Phase II study.
