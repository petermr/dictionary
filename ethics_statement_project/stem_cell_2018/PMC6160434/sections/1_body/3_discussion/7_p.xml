<p id="Par27">Rather than exerting a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells, DFMO exhibits a unique mechanism of action in that it inhibits ODC activity and reverses the effects of increased polyamine levels

 <italic>MYCN</italic>, which is amplified in approximately one-third of neuroblastomas and associated with high-risk behavior, is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression of ODC. Thus, it has been suggested that targeting ODC with DFMO would have greater effect on 
 <italic>MYCN</italic> amplified tumors

 <italic>MYCN</italic> status (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c/d</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), indicating that while DFMO's targeting of ODC may result in a relatively greater benefit for the 
 <italic>MYCN</italic> amplified group, subjects without 
 <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification also benefit. This may be as a result of DFMO's decrease of LIN28 which may affect the expression of multiple additional oncogenes through correction of the LIN28/Let7 axis derangement
