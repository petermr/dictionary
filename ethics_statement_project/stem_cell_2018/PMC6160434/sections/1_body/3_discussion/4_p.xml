<p id="Par24">Given that the entire cohort includes subjects who had received various standard-of-care therapies prior to starting DFMO, it is important to review the outcomes from other groups. While numbers are small, analysis of the subject cohorts that received non-COG frontline therapies also suggests benefit for DFMO maintenance therapy. A European study

 </sup>; analysis of their survival curves to correct for a lead-in period suggests that those who were event free at the completion of antibody therapy experienced a subsequent 2-year EFS of &lt;60%. Similarly, MSKCC reported on the survival of Stage IV patients who were further stratified into "high-risk” and "ultra-high-risk” groups. While analysis of the high risk cohort (excluding ultra-high risk patients) showed EFS of 69% and OS of 78% at 5 years post start of antibody (with an estimated EFS of 84% at two years following completion of antibody therapy), comparable analysis for the ultra-high-risk group were EFS of 44% and OS of 78% at five years post start of antibody, and an EFS of approximately 54% at two years following completion of antibody therapy
