<p id="Par2">Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common non-CNS pediatric solid tumor, occurring in one in 7000 children. Children with low- or intermediate-risk NB have an excellent prognosis with moderate courses of chemotherapy and/or surgical resection. In contrast, children with high-risk features (approximately 50% of cases) have five year event free survival (EFS) rates of 40–60% and overall survival (OS) rates of 55–75%, despite very intensive treatment regimens that typically include five to eight cycles of chemotherapy, maximal safe surgical resection of the tumor, one or two cycles of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support, radiation therapy, and anti-GD2 antibody plus

 </sup>. Even for children who successfully complete this therapy, survival is problematic: the most recent data published from the Children's Oncology Group (COG) showed that for those who responded to induction therapy and continued to consolidation and maintenance therapy, the EFS from the start of immunotherapy was 66% ± 5% at two years
