 </sup>. In addition, subjects in Stratum 1 must have completed standard high-risk NB therapy, defined as 5–6 cycles of chemotherapy based on Children’s Oncology Group (COG), Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), or International Society of Pediatric Oncology Europe Neuroblastoma (SIOPEN) regimens, followed by surgical resection of the primary tumor, 1–2 cycles of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support (except for subjects treated according to MSKCC protocols, who accounted for only 4% of enrolled subjects), radiation, and anti-GD2 antibody therapy combined with retinoic acid. Criteria for enrollment on Stratum 2 was completion of any therapy for relapsed disease, or any augmented therapy for primary refractory disease (defined as any subject who received additional therapy due to a suboptimal response to standard therapy). Criteria for both strata included age at diagnosis under 21 years; adequate hematologic parameters and organ function; a disease status of at least PR (by CT or MRI) at the time of study entry and histologically negative bone marrow aspirate/biopsy. Subjects with stable residual tumor masses visible on CT/MRI were enrolled if the residual mass was either MIBG negative or MIBG positive without FDG-PET avidity, which was taken as evidence that the mass did not represent active disease and would otherwise not have received additional therapy after antibody therapy. Initiation of DFMO was required within 120 days from completion of previous therapy.
