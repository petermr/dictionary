<p>A number of avenues have been explored to address these causes of mortality. T-cell-depleted and CD34+-"enriched” grafts entail higher economic costs but are still commonly used.

 </sup> These options tend to increase rates of engraftment while decreasing the rate of GVHD, but they also result in prolonged immune reconstitution, putting patients at higher risk of infection and relapse. Recent research has shone a spotlight on natural killer (NK) cells and γδ T cells, which might be helpful in the fight against viral infections and may improve graft-versus-leukemia responses.

 </sup> Along this same line of reasoning, recent graft manipulation approaches include the depletion of CD19+ and αβ T cells.

 </sup> These techniques emphasize the key role that immunoregulation likely plays in necessary improvements in post-HSCT mortality rates.
