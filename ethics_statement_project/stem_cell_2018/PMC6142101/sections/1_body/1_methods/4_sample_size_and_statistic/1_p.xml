<p>Estimations of power size were performed using the "diggle.linear.power” of the "longpower” package of R Version 3.4.0 (R Core Team, 2015). A general estimation equation (GEE) model with a normal distribution, identity function, and unstructured working correlation matrix structure was used on selected outcomes of the patients followed in the study. We estimate that a minimum of 10 patients in each group would be required for achieving statistical significance. According to our preliminary results (described below), although none of the patients dropped out of the trial, the mortality rate was roughly 38%, and only 33% of patients who commenced herbal treatment persisted for &gt;30 days. We therefore estimate that the recruitment of 50 patients in each group (n = 100) should be sufficient for a randomized controlled trial. The data from patients receiving SYT for 30 days or less who then cease its use for any reason should be excluded from analysis. Similarly, data of patients from the control group who expire prior to the 4 month posttransplantation time point should be excluded from analysis. The remaining data should be analyzed according to an intention-to-treat approach.</p>
