<p>PBMC obtained from patients were seeded (2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>) in 96-well rounded-bottom plates using Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, MA, USA) at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Cells were co-cultured for 24 and 48 hours with SYT (50, 100, and 200 µg/mL), paramethoxyamphetamine 50 ng/mL (Sigma-Aldrich), and ionomycin 500 ng/mL (Sigma-Aldrich). The concentrations of IL-2, TNF-α, and IFN-γ were measured using the appropriate ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) kits (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) as per manufacturer's instructions.
