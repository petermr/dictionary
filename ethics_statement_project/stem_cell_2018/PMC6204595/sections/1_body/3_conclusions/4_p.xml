<p>Of note was a reduced increase in muscle strength after the high‐dose treatment between weeks 6 and 12 after an initial larger increase. This finding could be related to a distinct pattern in immunomodulation by low‐dose treatment vs. high‐dose treatment as revealed by biomarker studies. Only in the high‐dose group did we observe signs of late‐onset immune activation in peripheral blood at week 6, which might explain the drop in efficacy in this specific dosage between weeks 6 and 12. While the peri‐operative rise in IL‐10 observed in the placebo group seems typical and is related to a systemic stress reaction triggering IL‐10 secretion in the liver,

 <xref rid="jcsm12316-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> The mechanisms behind bystander activation are the release of 'danger' signals in association with cytokines leading to unspecific intra‐tissue activation of pre‐activated NK‐ and T‐effector cells. The selected high dose (in the same volume as the low dose, meaning at higher cell concentrations) might have led to critical local conditions for the PLX‐PAD cells applied and may be associated with an increased rate of dying PLX‐PAD cells that would release danger signals.
