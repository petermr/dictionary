<p>PLX‐PAD cells were further characterized in our institute by in‐depth surface marker analysis. For this purpose, we applied the 'Human Cell Surface Marker Screening (PE)' Kit (Biolegend, San Diego, California, USA) using directly labelled antibodies for detecting surface markers. We compared several batches of PLX‐PAD cells with a bone‐marrow derived MSC line.

 <xref rid="jcsm12316-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarizes the data from the CD screen. PLX‐PAD cells showed the consensus expression profile of MSC, such as CD 73+ 90+ 105+ CD45‐31‐34 ‐. In line with the unique properties of PLX‐PAD cells compared with conventional MSC, however, they show a much broader expression profile. In summary, 43 of 243 surface markers screened were expressed by PLX‐PAD cells revealing a unique profile. Remarkably, there is a broader expression of various adhesion molecules (e.g. CD49 family, CD144), inhibitors of complement activation (e.g. CD46, CD55, CD59), and T‐cell function (e.g. PD‐L), molecules involved in signal transduction (e.g. CD140b, CD150), and molecules interacting with metalloproteinases (e.g. CD 10) but missing some markers expressed on bone marrow derived MSC which are involved in cell activation (e.g. CD109, CD112). This expression profile is in line with the proposed anti‐inflammatory, immunomodulatory, cell‐interaction, tissue homeostasis, and angiogenesis influencing properties of PLX‐PAD. Importantly, PLX‐PAD cells from different preparations or even from different donors expressed an almost identical marker profile underlying the robustness of the manufacturing process (not shown).
