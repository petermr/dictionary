<p>Quantitative PCR was performed as previously described (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). In brief, total RNA was extracted using RNeasy
 <sup>®</sup> Mini kit (QIAGEN, Toronto, ON, Canada) and then transcribed into complementary DNA using QuantiTect
 <sup>®</sup> Reverse Transcription kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative gene expression levels were determined using primers and TaqMan
 <sup>®</sup> FAM™-labeled MGB probes for ROR-γ, IL17, and ribosomal 18 S (VIC
 <sup>®</sup>-labeled probe) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Quantitative PCR cycling was performed for 40 cycles in a 7900HT fast-real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) as recommended by the manufacturer instructions. Gene-specific messenger RNA was normalized compared with 18S, the endogenous control.
