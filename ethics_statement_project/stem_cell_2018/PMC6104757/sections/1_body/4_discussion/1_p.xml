<p>In SSc, vascular complications are a major cause of morbidity, contribute to end-organ damage and have major impact on quality of life and healthcare costs. The efficacy and safety of MSC administration has been suggested in various conditions, including SSc. Local administration of various cell types for digital ulcers and/or hand stiffness in SSc has been investigated in several small uncontrolled studies, in which BM-MNC or adipose tissue derived cells were used.
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> These studies show that locoregional cell administration in the upper limb to treat digital ischaemia in SSc is safe and potentially effective.
 <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58 71–76</xref> Recent case reports that explored intravenous delivery suggest that administration of MSCs may be a worthwhile treatment option in SSc. However, controlled trials assessing the intramuscular administration route are lacking in SSc. Additionally, allogeneic BM-derived MSC therapy is attractive as it may be used as ‘off-the-shelf’ available treatment and uses functionally competent MSC from healthy donors.
