<p>We aim to avoid alterations to the medication regimen of patients during the trial. Drugs that can influence local perfusion should not be started between 4 weeks prior to MSC administration and 12 weeks after; dose changes are not allowed during this period. However, if it is deemed medically necessary, the medication regimen can be altered by the patient’s own rheumatologist. This may include additional iloprost infusions or other therapy directed to digital ulcers. Medication use, including analgesic use, will be carefully documented.</p>
