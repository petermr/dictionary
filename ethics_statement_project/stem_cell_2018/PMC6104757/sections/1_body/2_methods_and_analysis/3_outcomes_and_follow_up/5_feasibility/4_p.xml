<p>Concealment of treatment allocation will be assessed by asking participants and clinicians in which arm they think the participant was, using a three-point scale (‘verum’, ‘placebo’ or ‘don’t know’). To gain a balanced view, this question will be posed at 12 weeks (primary endpoint) and at 52 weeks (conclusion of the trial). Data will be analysed using James’ and Bang’s Blinding index to determine the degree of blinding in the trial, within each arm and whether this deviates from random chance.
