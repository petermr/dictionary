<p>The MANUS Trial will be overseen by the Internal Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) of the University Medical Center Utrecht. This is an independent DSMB, consisting of clinicians (including an expert on scleroderma), a biostatistician and a clinical epidemiologist. Every 3 months, the DSMB will review the status and conduct of the clinical trial, evaluate all causes of death and adverse events and make recommendations to the clinical research group concerning the trial's continuation and modification.</p>
