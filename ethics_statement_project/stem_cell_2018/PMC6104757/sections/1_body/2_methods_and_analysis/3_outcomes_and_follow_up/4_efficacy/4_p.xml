<p>While the study is not powered to assess efficacy, various outcome measures for efficacy will be assessed to assess their feasibility as an outcome as well as inform future power calculations. These outcome measures include change in patients-reported ulcer pain, quality of life as assessed with validated questionnaires (SF-36, S-HAQ, EQ5D), hand function as assessed with the Cochin Hand Function Scale, number of digital ulcers at 12 weeks, healing of ulcers at 12 weeks, area of digital ulcers, the need to alter the medication regimen during the study as determined by the patient’s own rheumatologist, the severity of SSc as assessed with the Modified Rodnan Skin Score, severity of Raynaud’s symptoms, changes in capillary morphology as visualised with video-assisted NFC, and changes in laboratory parameters including biomarkers for inflammation and endothelial (dys)function. Plasma, serum and peripheral blood MNCs will be sampled at baseline and 48 hours, 2, 4 and 12 weeks post-treatment, and a skin biopsy will be taken at baseline and at 12 weeks. For binary outcomes, the observed effect estimates and for continuous outcomes, the mean and SD can be used as a basis for future power calculations.</p>
