<p>Many of the secondary efficacy outcomes and some of the safety outcomes in the proposed study incorporate a degree of subjectivity and are therefore subject to bias from both patients and assessors. Given the considerable placebo effect that can be observed in trials assessing 'stem cell treatments', blinding of both clinicians as well as participants is of paramount importance. For instance, in MNC therapy for cardiac disease, early uncontrolled trials showed an effect, whereas later, more rigorously designed RCTs did not show an effect, despite the relatively robust outcome measures used.
