<p>The inclusion of a placebo control arm in the design of the MANUS Trial despite the relatively low number is important to properly evaluate feasibility, safety and secondary efficacy outcomes. A two-armed design will enable us to assess whether patients are willing to participate if a placebo arm is present. The possibility of randomisation can have a major impact on participant accrual; for instance, in the reJUVenating ENdothelial progenitor cells via Transcutaneous intra-Arterial Supplementation (JUVENTAS trial), one-third of potentially eligible patients was excluded due to unwillingness to participate in a randomised trial, even though this represented a 'no option' population who had no other alternatives than conservative management or amputation.
