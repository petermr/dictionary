<p>The European League Against Rheumatism guideline recommends intravenous iloprost, bosentan or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE-5i) for the management of patients with digital ulcerations.
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Intravenous iloprost, the first-line treatment for digital ischaemia in SSc, has been shown to reduce ulcers by 50% in at most 28% of treated patients in a randomised placebo-controlled trial.
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Bosentan, an endothelin-1 receptor antagonist, has been shown to reduce new ulcer occurrence in two double-blind placebo-controlled trials,

 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Similarly, while PDE-5i have shown promising results in healing digital ulcers, in a recent double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT), 18% of the patients in the PDE-5i arm did not show ulcer healing.
