<p>Regarding the safety, occurrence of AEs for the 2 products appeared to be similar (
 <xref rid="t2-dddt-12-2381" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The most frequent AE was pain, which was consistent with the pivotal clinical trial that showed around 20% of patients with mild-to-moderate bone pain.
 <xref rid="b20-dddt-12-2381" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Regardless of product, pain seems to occur depending on dose. Almost double the subjects suffered from pain when the dose doubled. In other biosimilar filgrastim products, pain-related disorders were also the major AEs and, generally, the safety profile was comparable.

 <xref rid="b25-dddt-12-2381" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Disorders related to laboratory results such as neutropenia or "blood creatinine phosphokinase increased” were only observed in this study. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that the AEs are product-specific, and it is possibly attributed to the AE collection method because the AEs were observed both in the test and the reference.
