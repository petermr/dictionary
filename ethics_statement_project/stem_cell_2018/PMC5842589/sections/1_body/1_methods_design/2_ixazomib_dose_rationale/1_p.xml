<p id="Par76">The lack of a discernible relationship between body surface area (BSA) and ixazomib clearance over a relatively wide BSA range (1.4â€“2.6 m
 <sup>2</sup>) indicates that total systemic exposure (area under the curve, AUC), following fixed dosing, should be independent of the individual patient's BSA. Therefore, BSA is not expected to affect maximum plasma drug concentration (C
 <sub>max</sub>) or AUC after IV administration or oral dosing, and thus fixed dosing is appropriate for both oral and IV routes of administration. The clinical development of ixazomib has therefore transitioned from the use of BSA-based dosing to fixed dosing in all recently initiated Takeda phase I/II studies (e.g. Studies C16005 phase II, C16007, C16008 and C16009). Accordingly, the starting dose of ixazomib in the ACCoRd study is a fixed dose of 4.0 mg, on the basis of the recommended dose of 2.23 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> (using a mean patient BSA of 1.86 m
 <sup>2</sup> from the 2208 patients with MM in VELCADE clinical studies for conversion to a fixed dose).
