<p>Of the 96 patients in the safety analysis set, 78 achieved a sustained MR
 <sup>4.5</sup> on nilotinib consolidation and entered the TFR phase, including 33 patients (42.3%) who were treated with nilotinib following imatinib prior to enrollment in STAT2. Most patients (n=29, 72.5%) were switched from imatinib to nilotinib at the patients' request prior to the trial, primarily to obtain a deeper and more sustained MR, despite not having imatinib resistance or intolerance. Similarly, the ENESTcmr study showed that a significant minority of patients who continued with imatinib therapy did later achieve DMR.

 </sup> In the subanalysis evaluating prior TKI exposure, the 12-month TFR was almost identical between patients treated with only imatinib (62.5%) and those treated with nilotinib following imatinib (69.7%). This suggests that, regardless of the specific TKI, DMR is the first step for achieving successful TFR in patients with CML.
