<p>An analysis of baseline factors as predictors of TFR at 12 months was conducted. With the exception of detectable MRD before entering the TFR phase (odds ratio, 0.369; 95% CI: 0.138–0.988; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.0473), there were no significant predictors in the univariate logistic regression analysis, including the absolute number of natural killer cells and natural killer cell cytotoxicity (
 <xref rid="t3-1031835" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Multivariate analysis was not, therefore, performed. On the other hand, the treatment-free survival curve was significantly better in the UMRD with MR
 <sup>5</sup> group than in the MRD group (estimated 3-year treatment-free survival, 75.6 
 <italic>versus</italic> 48.6%; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.0126 by the log-rank test) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1031835">Figure 1C</xref>). There were no significant differences in the treatment-free survival curves between subgroups based on TKI treatment prior to the consolidation phase by nilotinib (‘imatinib only’ 
 <italic>versus</italic> ‘nilotinib following imatinib’ group, 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.9508 by the log-rank test), presence of TKI withdrawal syndrome (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.4096 by the log-rank test), or absolute number of natural killer cells (≥ median 
 <italic>versus</italic> &lt; median, 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.4527 by the log-rank test).
