<p>The median age in the safety analysis set was 55.5 years (range, 20–83). Thirty-six (37.5%) patients were female and 16 (16.7%) patients had been administered interferon α before TKI treatment. Based on TKI therapy prior to entry into the current study, patients were classified into three groups: 50 patients (52.1%) who had received only imatinib ('imatinib only'), 40 patients (41.7%) who had received nilotinib following imatinib ('nilotinib following imatinib', including patients from the STAT1 study), and six patients (6.3%) who had received other therapy ('other'). The STAT1 study (Switch to Tasigna
 <sup>®</sup> Trial) is a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of 2-year consolidation treatment with nilotinib for achieving DMR in chronic phase CML patients with MMR, recently reported by our study group.

 </sup> Among 40 patients in STAT2 treated by nilotinib following imatinib, 21 patients joined this study from STAT1 since they achieved MR
 <sup>4.5</sup> in the STAT1 study. The reasons for switching from imatinib to nilotinib in the 40 patients included imatinib resistance in 7.5%, imatinib intolerance in 20.0%, and upon patients' request in 72.5% (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Table S1</italic>). The median duration of imatinib or nilotinib treatment was 73.6 months (range, 11–126) or 7.7 months (range, 0–35), respectively. All patients showed MR
 <sup>4.5</sup> at the time of entry into the study, and the median time to MR
 <sup>4.5</sup> on TKI therapy was 48.1 months (range, 6–128). Among 96 patients in the safety analysis set, 70 (73.7%) achieved the MR
 <sup>4.5</sup> by prior imatinib treatment and 25 (26.3%) by prior nilotinib treatment. Comparing patients in different subgroups based on prior TKI therapy ('imatinib only' 
 <italic>versus</italic> 'nilotinib following imatinib'), there were no significant differences except in the duration of imatinib therapy and time to MR
 <sup>4.5</sup> (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Table S1</italic>). Of these, 40 patients in the 'imatinib only' group, 33 patients in the 'nilotinib following imatinib' group, and five patients in the 'other' group entered the TFR phase.
