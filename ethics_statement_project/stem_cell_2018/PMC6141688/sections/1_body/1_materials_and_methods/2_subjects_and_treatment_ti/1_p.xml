Before donating HSCs, donors received 10 μg G-CSF/kg/day (“Nivestim™”, filgrastim, Pfizer) over 4 days to be able to donate HSCs by a continuous flow apheresis procedure. The second donor blood sample was collected on the day of HSC harvest, thus at day 5 after 4 days of G-CSF treatment, immediately before the apheresis procedure started (Figure
