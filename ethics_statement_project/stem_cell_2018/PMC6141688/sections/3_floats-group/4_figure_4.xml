  <p>The chemotactic activity remains impaired in allogeneic transplant recipients. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Distribution of half migration time in the stem cell donors before G-CSF treatment (
   <italic>n</italic> = 10), serving as controls, and samples from patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation at a medium of 48.9 days (
   <italic>n</italic> = 9), indicated as sample 1, and 80.2 days (
   <italic>n</italic> = 12), indicated as sample 2, after transplant, respectively. The half migration time is measured as the time it takes to reach half of max fluorescent and is a measure of neutrophil speed in the process of chemotaxis. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The distribution of velocity during chemotaxis comparing stem cell donors before G-CSF with samples from patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation as described above. The evaluation shows that the velocity at half max migration goes down early after allogeneic stem cell transplantation which confirms that the chemotaxis in neutrophils is slower early after stem cell transplantation. Statistical analysis was performed with a Kruskal–Wallis test for 
   <bold>(A)</bold> (
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.0466) and 
   <bold>(B)</bold> (
   <italic>p</italic> = complemented with Mann–Whitney U-tests showing that samples "before G-CSF treatment” and "allogeneic sample 1” are significantly different for 
   <bold>(A,B)</bold> with
