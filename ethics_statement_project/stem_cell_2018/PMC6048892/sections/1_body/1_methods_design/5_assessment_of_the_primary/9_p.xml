<p id="Par49">For the last patient in, the final study visit will be 12 months after baseline. This is considered the final study visit (last patient out). All other patients will be followed regularly as described in detail until death or until 12 months after baseline. Beyond that, all patients can be followed within routine clinical visits according to national guidelines and survival and progression data will be documented until 'last patient out'. If death occurs at less than 12 months or patients leave the study prior to 12 months, they will be still included into the intention-to-treat population.</p>
