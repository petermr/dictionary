<p>To protect the patients' safety during the trial, the results will be monitored by a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), consisting of an experienced biostatistician and a clinician with long experience of clinical trials. Both are independent of the sponsor and will provide an impartial recommendation for the continuation of the study. Separate working instructions will be provided as a 'charter' to the DMC. A conservative stopping rule according to the O'Brien-Fleming boundary will be applied to minimise the effect of the interim analysis on the statistical strength at the end of the trial.</p>
