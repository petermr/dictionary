<p>The patients will undergo balanced randomisation with randomly varying block sizes (two, four or six patients) where one, two or three experiments are distributed in sequences and one, two or three controls. A block can be, for example, 'ce' if there are two patients, and 'ceec' and 'eeccec' if there are four or six patients, respectively. Each hospital is blinded to the size of the blocks.</p>
