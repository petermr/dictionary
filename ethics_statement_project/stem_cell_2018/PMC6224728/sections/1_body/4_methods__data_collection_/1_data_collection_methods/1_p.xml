<p>All measurements, with the exception of the patient's subjective assessment of the cooling method, will be registered beginning at admission and will continue until discharge or until day +28. Cytostatic infusion generally starts on the day after admission. Grading of OM according to OMAS and WHO is done three times a week, for example, Monday, Wednesday and Friday, by a dentist/dental hygienist. For each day the patient is hospitalised, assessment with WHO is also performed by nurses/assistant nurses who are not blinded to the treatment group. Clinical routines differ between study centres and therefore the number of assessments can be lower during the week of admission, depending on when patients are admitted.</p>
