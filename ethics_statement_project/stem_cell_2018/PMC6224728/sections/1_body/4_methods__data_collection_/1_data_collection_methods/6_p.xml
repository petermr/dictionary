<p>Rating of pain is done with the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS) one to two times daily if the patient is kept on the ward. Alternatively, it is done every other day according to the respective department's routine for outpatient care if the patient is at home or in a home-like environment. In the case of outpatients, the subjective rating of pain is noted in the patient documentation through daily telephone contact with the responsible nurse. Body temperature is registered in the oral cavity, ear or axillary region in accordance with the department's routines.</p>
