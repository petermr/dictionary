<p>The degree of OM is assessed at eight intraoral locations, in accordance with the OMAS (graded 0–3 for ulceration and 0–2 for erythema). Zero corresponds to ‘normal’ while 3 and 2 are ‘sore &gt;3 cm
 <sup>2</sup>’ and ‘severe erythema’, respectively. The assessment generates both an average for OMAS ulceration (0–3) and OMAS erythema (0–2) and a total average OMAS (0–5), which is the mean of both ulceration and erythema.
