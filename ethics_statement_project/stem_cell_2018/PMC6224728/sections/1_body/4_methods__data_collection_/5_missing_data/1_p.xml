<p>OMAS (total) and WHO performed by dentists/dental hygienist after treatment are replaced with WHO performed by nurses. WHO replacing OMAS (total) will be translated into OMAS (total).
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In the final analysis, the dentist assessment is primarily used. For OMAS subindex, the highest value is used as the peak OMAS subindex if at least one OMAS subindex is available after treatment. If there is no OMAS subindex after treatment, the patient's baseline is used as peak OMAS subindex.
