 </sup> consistent correlations were not found. In a phase 2 study of patients with relapsed AML treated with clofarabine and temsirolomus, correlation of response to dephosphorylation of pS6RP (S6 ribosomal protein) was demonstrated.

 </sup> However the target cells were the patients' own blasts, which were not available in the current study and it was unclear whether the clinical outcome was superior to that which clofarabine alone could achieve.
