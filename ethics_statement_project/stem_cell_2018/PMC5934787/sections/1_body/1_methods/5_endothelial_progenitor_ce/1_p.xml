<p id="Par61">Peripheral blood samples (approximately 60Â ml) were drawn from patients and diluted in phosphate buffered saline (1:1). Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were then isolated from whole blood using a Ficoll density centrifugation method. MNCs were counted and an aliquot was used for CFU-Hill colony formation assay following the manufacturer's instructions (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada). At day 5 colony forming units (CFU) were counted. A fraction of MNCs were stained with (FITC, PE, APC)-conjugated antibodies (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) in order to analyze specific endothelial cell surface markers (CD34, CD31, CXCR4) by flow cytometry.</p>
