<p id="Par65">Arterial stiffness was assessed through pulse wave analysis (PWA), and pulse wave velocity (PWV). PWA was obtained from the radial artery while the subjects were seated at rest. Investigators tried to obtain a minimum of three measures, with an operator index score ≥ 80. PWA measures include: augmentation index (AI), Augmentation Index adjusted for a heart rate of 75 (AI-75), augmentation pressure (AP), and both systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP, DBP) measured both centrally and peripherally. PWV measures the velocity of the pulse as it moves from a “proximal” artery to a “distal” artery. The designated proximal artery was the carotid, however, occasionally the radial artery was used if no carotid measurement could be obtained. The designated distal artery was the femoral artery, with no alternative used. PWV was obtained with subjects supine, at rest. Investigators tried to obtain a minimum of two measures, each with a standard deviation of less than 10%. These measured were gathered using the AtCor SphygmoCor CP system.</p>
