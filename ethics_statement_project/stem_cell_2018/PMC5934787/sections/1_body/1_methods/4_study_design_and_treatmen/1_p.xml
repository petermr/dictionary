Diet counseling was also provided. At visit 1, baseline values of the following measures were gathered: blood biochemistries, vitals, biophysical parameters, resting energy expenditure (REE), arterial stiffness measures, and endothelial progenitor cells analysis. Subjects were then randomized to one of two arms: saxagliptin 5 mg/day or placebo, in a blinded manner. Subjects took either saxagliptin (n = 21) or placebo (n = 21) for 12 weeks, while engaging in 150 min of moderate intensity physical activity per week. Visits were conducted every 6 weeks, ending at week 12 (visit 3).</p>
