<p id="Par75">The CFU-Hill’s colonies formation was improved in the saxagliptin treatment group. The ascendant curve in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows that CFU numbers increased across 12 weeks (visit 1–3) of saxagliptin treatment, while a decline in the curve was found in the placebo group. Despite these results being close to statistical significance (p = 0.07), they clearly indicate a positive effect of the drug on the functionality of the endothelial cell lineage, and the lack of full significance is likely due to a small sample size.
