<p id="Par100">Our study shows a reduction in arterial stiffness in the saxagliptin group, as seen through a reduction in AI-75. This was also seen with other DPP-4 inhibitors, sitagliptin and vildagliptin, which resulted in a reduction in AI-75 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Arterial stiffness, as measured via AI-75, is a strong predictor of CVD in Type 2 Diabetes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The reduction in AI-75 may be attributed to a multi-platform effect. DPP-4 inhibitors cause an increase in systemic incretin levels, which can cause a relaxation of the arteries via nitric oxide (NO) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. This could be attributed to a reduction in arterial stiffness. Also, the increase in CFU and higher percentage of CD34+ CXCR4+ that was reported in our cellular analysis may indicate that EPCs are having a regenerative effect on the subjects' arteries across the 12-week time-period. Finally, DPP-4 inhibitors help patients achieve a better level of glycemic control, and, as observed from our body composition results, a decrease in both percent fat and fat free mass. This decline in adiposity may also contribute to the improvement (reduced PWA) in arterial stiffness.
