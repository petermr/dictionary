<p id="Par99">Arterial stiffness, is a measure of compliance of one's arteries, and their ability to constrict and dilate in response to blood pressure [

PWV, in addition to PWA measures such as blood pressure and augmentation index, have been found to be a predictor of increased CVD risk in the general population, and especially in those at an increased risk, such as patients with type 2 diabetes [
