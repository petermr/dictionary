<p id="Par90">Based on the CFU-Hills’s colony count and migratory response to SDF-1α results (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, respectively), we demonstrated that saxagliptin enhances EPCs functionality. Considering that CFU-Hill’s colonies number is inversely related to Framingham risk score, these results also indicate a decrease in CVD risk promoted by the use of saxagliptin and metformin combination, in addition to exercise.
