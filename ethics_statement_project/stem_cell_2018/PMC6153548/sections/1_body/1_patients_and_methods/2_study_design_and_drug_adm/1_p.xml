<p id="Par7">Patients received IMGN529 intravenously on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. The number of cycles was not fixed and patients received IMGN529 until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent, whichever came first. A conventional 3 + 3 dose-escalation scheme was used, with the first three patient cohort dosed at 0.1 mg/kg. In the initial low dose cohorts, early-onset neutropenia and febrile neutropenia (within 4 days of dosing) were observed and at the 0.4 mg/kg dose level the use of peri-infusional steroid prophylaxis was mandated. Accordingly, patients received 10 mg dexamethasone intravenously 30–60 min prior to infusion and were provided with oral corticosteroids (8 mg dexamethasone or equivalent) to be taken at home on days 2 and 3. However, at the 1.0 mg/kg plus steroid prophylaxis dosing level, febrile neutropenia and neutropenia were experienced by the first three patients treated; these events displayed a delayed-onset profile (days 12–15). Granulocyte growth factor support was subsequently added as primary prophylaxis in every cycle in the days following IMGN529 infusion. This was administered between days 3–10 of each cycle, with the type and duration of growth factor support based on investigator's decision as per local practice. The combination of peri-infusional steroids and granulocyte growth factor support allowed dose escalation to proceed.</p>
