<p id="Par24">In this study, five patients developed secondary B cell lymphoma, of whom three had AITL and two had PTCL-NOS, consistent with the general distribution in our study cohort. EBV-driven B cell lymphoproliferation and EBV-related B cell lymphoma secondary to immunosuppression have been reported in patients with AITL and PTCL-NOS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Clonal expansion of EBV-negative B cells has also been described in patients with PTCLs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. EBV status was not assessed at enrollment in our study; patients were not treated with anti-viral agents as prophylaxis, and all patients had received prior immunosuppressive chemotherapy. Thus, it cannot be excluded that the secondary lymphomas were already evolving before forodesine initiation. No clear difference was observed between total lymphocyte and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> lymphocyte counts for patients who did or did not develop secondary B cell lymphoma, and risk factors for development of secondary B cell lymphoma were not identified in this study. Future studies should investigate whether EBV status at baseline or during forodesine treatment influences risk of secondary B cell lymphoma. In addition, sufficient attention must be placed on risk of opportunistic infection given that forodesine's mechanism of action leads to T cell reductions.
