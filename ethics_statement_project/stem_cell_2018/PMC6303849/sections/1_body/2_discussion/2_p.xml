<p id="Par74">The Korean Association for the Study of the Liver clinical practice guidelines for the management of alcoholic liver disease (2013) recommend liver transplantation when there is no remarkable reduction in jaundice (Lille model score ≥ 0.56) 1 week after steroid treatment is initiated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, in addition to a shortage of donor organs, it calls for pre-transplant 6-month abstinence from alcohol as a prerequisite for liver transplantation in most transplant centers; therefore, it is practically difficult to follow the recommendation of "considering a liver transplant” as viable.
