<p id="Par17">Strengths of this study are the prospective, longitudinal design and the participation of haematologists/oncologists across Germany. This study is limited by the sole enrolment of patients receiving systemic therapy, excluding patients under "watch and wait,‚Äù patients refusing such treatment as well as frail patients not able to receive systemic therapy or patients receiving local therapy (surgery, radiotherapy) only. Due to the observational design of this registry study, there is no randomisation of treatment or study sites and thus causal relations cannot be drawn. Trial ineligibility was defined using frequently applied exclusion criteria from phase III clinical trials. The proportion of trial-ineligible patients may be underestimated because not all data for exclusion criteria from clinical trials had been collected in the TLN registry. On the other hand, all patients with polyneuropathy or renal insufficiency were excluded, regardless of the grade/severity, possibly overestimating the proportion of trial-ineligible patients. There are no specifications as to the timing, frequency, or criteria of tumour assessment; thus, clinical PFS data should be considered as the best clinical approximation and might not be identical to the PFS determined in clinical trials.</p>
