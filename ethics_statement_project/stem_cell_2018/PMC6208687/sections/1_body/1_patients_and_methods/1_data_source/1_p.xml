The present analysis focuses on 490 patients with systemic treatment of MM recruited between April 2009 and November 2011 in 84 medical oncology centres across Germany. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Treatment of patients started within 4 weeks prior or until 8 weeks after signing informed consent. Patients were treated according to physicians' choice and visits were scheduled individually; no specifications for treatment were imposed at any time. All patients were followed until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or up to 5 years from enrolment. Follow-up was limited to 5 years due to limited funding. The TLN has previously been described in detail [
