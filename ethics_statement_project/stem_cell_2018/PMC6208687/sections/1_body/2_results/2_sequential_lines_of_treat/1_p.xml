 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). 48% of the trial-ineligible patients died before receiving a third-line treatment (Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Patients marked as "potential” for another line of treatment had either not yet completed the previous line of treatment or had finished the previous line but not yet started a new one or had completed the 5-year follow-up period.
