 </sup> The time required for daily ulcer care and provider appointments can result in decreased participation in school, work, or family activities. The Clinical Trial Consortium for Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers identified factors negatively associated with QOL.

 </sup> Older age, specifically ages 30 to 50, vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), asthma, AVN, and concurrent use of opioid and antidepressants, all reduced QOL scores. In other studies, sickle leg ulcers have had significant individual effects on the scores of the SF-36 survey, a generic measure of QOL.

 </sup> However, studies reporting the role of sickle leg ulcers on health-related QOL are limited.
