<p>This study aimed to quantify perceived health-related QOL metrics in a small cohort of patients with SCD and chronic ulcers before and after topical sodium nitrite therapy. Overall, baseline SF-36 component summary scores showed that these lower extremity ulcers had the potential to negatively influence the individuals' physical QOL (PCS), more than mental QOL (MCS). Previous studies have described similar outcomes in sickle cell patients and have correlated subjective pain at the ulcer site to impaired QOL.

 </sup> It was not surprising that PCS was lower than MCS scores in our leg ulcer cohort, since pain had a greater impact on PCS scores.

 </sup> It was also noteworthy to point out that leg ulcer pain may have contributed to pain crises, since the mean PCS score was lower in those with at least one VOC in the preceding 12 months (32.7 ± 10.9), compared to those without VOC (36.5 ± 7.7,
