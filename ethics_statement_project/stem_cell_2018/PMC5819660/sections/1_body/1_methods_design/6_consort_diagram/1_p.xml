 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Consecutive thrombocytopenic patients who have an indication for central venous catheterisation are screened. Demographic data are registered regardless of meeting enrolment criteria using a predefined screen log. If patients are excluded for participation, the reason(s) for exclusion are registered. For the screening of thrombocytopenia, routinely conducted laboratory values are used. The indication for a CVC is determined at the physician's discretion.
