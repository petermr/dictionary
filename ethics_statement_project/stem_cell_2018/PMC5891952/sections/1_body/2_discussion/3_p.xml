<p id="Par17">In view of the above theoretical and practical experience, autologous BMMSCs were isolated, cultured, and transplanted into the patient's left ischemic lower extremities. Other than one reported recurrence at 9 months, bullosis diabeticorum and the associated cellulitis went into remission after transplantation therapy in the following 10Â years. In a meta-analysis study by Rigato et al., they showed that cell therapy reduced the risk of amputation by 37% and improved limb salvage by 18% and wound healing by 59%. Cell therapy also significantly increased ABI and transcutaneous oxygen pressure and reduced rest pain [

We speculated that the effects of transplanted stem cells might be gradual, starting from cellular differentiation, proliferation, and formation of new capillaries, and eventually improve the lower limb blood flow. At the start of the therapy period, formation of capillary networks and establishment of collateral circulation would not be adequate in ischemic tissue, which may induce another recurrence of bullosis diabecticorum. As blood flow and lower limb ischemia improve, the occurrence slowly tapers off. Thus, stem cell therapy provides an additional, viable option for patients who are ineligible for revascularization procedures. In another meta-analysis study by Fadini et al., the authors reported that traditional revascularization is not suitable for more than one-third of patients and these may benefit from stem cell therapies [
