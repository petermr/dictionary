<p id="Par133">The primary outcome variable will be analyzed with chi-square for comparison of dichotomized GOSE (favorable vs unfavorable) between intervention and sham. The second outcome measures for GOSE at 1 and 6 months after stimulation will be calculated in the same way as for the primary outcome measures. The results of the scales of DAI severity (Gennarelli’s), Adams, and Marshall will be compared with the results of the sham group with the Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test. The second outcome measures related to hemodynamic evaluation will be analyzed with the 
 <italic>t</italic> test for means and SD comparison of 1, 3, and 6 months with the basal value before stimulation.
