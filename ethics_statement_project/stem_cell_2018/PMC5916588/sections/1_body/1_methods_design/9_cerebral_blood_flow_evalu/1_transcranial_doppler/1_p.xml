<p id="Par102">All patients will be evaluated by transcranial Doppler before the first stimulation and after the last one. Evaluation will be done by a doctor expert in transcranial Doppler who will not be aware of the patient's group (intervention vs sham). The transcranial Doppler parameters of evaluation include the following: blood flow velocities (systolic and diastolic) of the bilateral middle cerebral arteries as well as the basilar artery. The device that will be used for measuring is a transcranial Doppler ultrasound (LOGIQ; GE Healthcare Systems, Wauwatosa, WI, USA, 2012) with a 2-MHz transducer. The mean flow velocity (cm/s) will be obtained every second (sampling rate of 1Â Hz) and saved for analysis. The three best measures of the systolic velocity, diastolic velocity, pulsatility index, and resistance index will be selected to calculate the mean values [
