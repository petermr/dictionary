It was discovered that near-infrared wavelengths (800&#x02013;900&#x000a0;nm) and red (600&#x000a0;nm) light-emitting diodes (LED) are able to penetrate through the scalp and skull and have the potential to improve the subnormal cellular activity of compromised brain tissue. Different experimental and clinical studies were performed to test LED therapy for traumatic brain injury (TBI) with promising results. One of the proposals of this present study is to develop different approaches to maximize the positive effects of this therapy and improve the quality of life of TBI patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">This is a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial of patients with diffuse axonal injury (DAI) due to a severe TBI in an acute stage (less than 8&#x000a0;h). Thirty&#x000a0;two patients will be randomized to active coil helmet and inactive coil (sham) groups in a 1:1 ratio. The protocol includes 18 sessions of transcranial LED stimulation (627&#x000a0;nm, 70&#x000a0;mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, 10&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup>) at four points of the frontal and parietal regions for 30&#x000a0;s each, totaling 120&#x000a0;s, three times per week for 6&#x000a0;weeks, lasting 30&#x000a0;min. Patients will be evaluated with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) before stimulation and 1, 3, and 6&#x000a0;months after the first stimulation. The study hypotheses are as follows: (1) transcranial LED therapy (TCLT) will improve the cognitive function of DAI patients and (2) TCLT will promote beneficial hemodynamic changes in cerebral circulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This study evaluates early and delayed effects of TCLT on the cognitive rehabilitation for DAI following severe acute TBI.

Recently, there has been an increase of 14% of TBI cases presenting to the emergency department [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Recent studies show that about 124,000 (43.1%) of TBI patients discharged from acute hospitalizations developed TBI-related long-term disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The definition of disability was focused on findings from a previous population-based study, which included considerable difficulty or inability to perform activities of daily living, the presence of a post-injury symptom preventing patients from doing things they intend to do, and poor cognitive and mental health levels on standard measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">It is relevant to mention that these data are likely underestimated, as the data published are solely from hospitalizations only. Thus, they probably do not include TBI patients treated in other settings or for whom treatment was not sought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Radiological features of DAI and clinical presentation</title><p id="Par25">Recent data accepted that diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is now one of the most common types of primary lesions in patients with severe head trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. DAI not accompanied by an intracranial mass lesion occurs in approximately 50% of patients with severe TBI and causes 35% of all TBI deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Patients with DAI present with important impairment of consciousness from the moment of trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. DAI is the most common cause of persistent vegetative state and severe disability in TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Damage to the reticular activating system is proportional to the level and duration of coma noted after DAI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Autonomic dysfunction symptoms seen in DAI (such as temperature control and satiety center disorders) have been associated with injury to the hypothalamus, which controls these activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">In the chronic phase, DAI in milder forms can lead to residual neuropsychiatric problems and cognitive deficits, including concentration difficulties, focal neurologic lesions, memory loss, decreased attention span, intellectual decline, psychiatric disturbances, headaches, and seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These disability symptoms are known as post-concussion syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. DAI should be suspected in all closed head injury patients with persistent and significant impairment of consciousness in the acute phase or residual neuropsychiatric deficits in the chronic phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Disability symptoms caused by brain lesions are not usually evident in structural computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. CT may show some petechial foci of hemorrhage in the acute phase, but it underestimates DAI extent because less than 20% of DAI lesions are hemorrhagic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Other radiologic features which could be appear are as follows: (1) single or multiple small intraparenchymal hemorrhages in the cerebral hemispheres (&#x0003c;2&#x000a0;cm in diameter); (2) intraventricular hemorrhage; (3) hemorrhage in the corpus callosum; (4) small focal areas of hemorrhage adjacent to the third ventricle (&#x0003c;2&#x000a0;cm in diameter); (5) brain stem hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Intraventricular hemorrhage arises from disruption of the subependymal plexus of the capillaries and veins that lie along the ventricular surface of the septum pellucidum, fornix, and corpus callosum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">DAI is caused by shearing forces which transect small blood vessels running in parallel with axons, leading to detectable microscopic hemorrhages. Gradient echo and T2*-weighted MR images detect signal dropout provoked by ion-containing heme groups in slow-moving blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. MRI is more sensitive in the identification of shearing injuries because it enables detection of non-hemorrhagic as well as hemorrhagic lesions. The axoplasmic leakage and edema around areas of neuronal disruption in non-hemorrhagic lesions are more conspicuous on T2-weighted images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) MRI scans can show DAI signs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. DTI is sensitive to detect water diffusion in the brain, presenting microstructural lesions in white matter tracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">There are five white matter regions of interest where one can usually see the lesions:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par31">Anterior corona radiata (41% of TBI cases)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32">Uncinate fasciculus (29% of TBI cases)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par33">Genu of the corpus callosum (21% of TBI cases)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par34">Inferior longitudinal fasciculus (21% of TBI cases)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par35">Cingulum bundle (18% of TBI cases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par36">The loss of connectivity in the aforementioned tracts (DAI) is responsible for all the symptoms and signs of disability following TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Principles of transcranial red/NIR LED photobiomodulation</title><p id="Par37">The use of red or near-infrared (NIR) light to stimulate or regenerate tissue is called photobiomodulation. Trying to repeat an experiment performed in Boston, USA, the Hungarian Endre Mester accidentally discovered this process. He tried to use laser beams to destroy cancer cells experimentally implanted into a laboratory rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. His mistake was to build a ruby laser that was only a tiny fraction of the power of the laser that had previously been used in Boston by McGuff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Thus, he noticed that hair had regrown and wound had healed in the stimulated area where the tumor had been implanted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Sometime after that, about 30&#x000a0;years ago, cadaver studies showed that NIR wavelengths (800&#x02013;900&#x000a0;nm) and red (600&#x000a0;nm) could penetrate through the scalp and skull (about 2&#x02013;3% of them can penetrate 1&#x000a0;cm from the cortex) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. They also have the potential to improve the subnormal cellular activity of compromised brain tissue.</p><p id="Par39">Photobiomodulation is a therapeutic tool for hypoxic, infected, and ischemic wounds. It also shows effectiveness in healing, reducing edema and inflammation, relieving pain, treating chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases, recovery from ischemic heart disease, and attenuating degeneration of the optic nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Multiple studies testing its effects in TBI are in course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Wavelengths within the far-red to the near-infrared range (630&#x02013;1000&#x000a0;nm) along with a minimal energy density of 4&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup> are the optimal therapeutic intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Stimulating biological processes proved to be effective with these wavelengths and energy density.

CCO acts by absorbing light photon and avoiding nitric oxide (NO) inhibitory effect on itself.

It is one of the brain recovery mechanisms after TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">Current small studies with acute severe TBI mice used transcranial NIR photobiomodulation to treat them. These studies have supported the notion that transcranial photobiomodulation increases neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. The protocol began 4&#x000a0;h post-TBI, and they discovered that there was significantly better recovery at 28&#x000a0;days post-TBI in mice receiving three daily transcranial NIR photobiomodulation treatments when compared to controls.
