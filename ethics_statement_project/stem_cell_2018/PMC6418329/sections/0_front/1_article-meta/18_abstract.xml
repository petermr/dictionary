  <bold>Introduction:</bold> Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a debilitating disease in which Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) is ≤ 40%, and it involves various organs. Regarding the novelty of stem cell therapy in HF, we aimed at studying the effect of stem cell therapy on the QoL of patients with HFrEF.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> In a prospective study, 30 patients diagnosed with HFrEF who had undergone stem cell injection (study group) and 30 patients with HFrEF receiving guideline-directed medical therapy (control group) were recruited by convenience sampling during 2016 in Mashhad, Iran. Patients' quality of life, left ventricular ejection fraction and their disability degree were studied twice with a 3-month interval. For data analysis, paired t-test, chi2 and multivariate linear regression were used.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Results:</bold> The mean age of study and control groups was 61.3±10.24 and 60.93±7.88 years respectively. Ninety percent of the cases and 56.7% of the controls were male (P=0.003). A significant difference in QoL was observed before and after treatment in each group (P&lt;0.05). However, the QoL score showed no statistical difference between the two groups following treatment (P=0.13). The same result was achieved for LVEF (P=0.18); whereas the NYHA function class showed a significant difference between the two groups following treatment (P=0.017).
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Conclusions:</bold> According to the results, it seems that the treatment of HFrEF patients with stem cells is as effective as conventional therapies in improving the LVEF and QoL and more efficient than conventional treatments in increasing the patients' general satisfaction with life.
