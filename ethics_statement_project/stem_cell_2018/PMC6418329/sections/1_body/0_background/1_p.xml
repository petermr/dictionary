<p>Variable classifications have been introduced for heart failure (HF) based on the severity of clinical symptoms, clinical stages or ejection fraction. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a debilitating disease in which Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) is â‰¤ 40% and involves various organs resulting in increased mortality rates or severe clinical disability in the patient [

Medical treatments have in some cases led to increased survival and better QoL, besides the increased tendency to non-medical therapeutic options. Today, heart transplantation can be a peculiar option for end-stage HFrEF, but it has many complications and is not eligible for all patients. Ten years ago, the administration of stem cells was introduced as a therapeutic alternative for HF patients, especially for those cases resulting from cardiac ischemia or infarction [
