<p>In 2011, Prin et al. investigated the efficiency of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells injection in improving the cellular function of patients with ischemic HF. The angina score and tissue perfusion in the group treated with stem cells improved significantly, and regarding age, the therapeutic response was significantly higher in younger patients. In addition, the 6-month QoL score showed a significant improvement in comparison to the medical therapy group [

The findings of this study correlated in satisfaction but not in the QoL; this could be due to the methodology, cases and controls characteristics, evaluation methods and the questionnaire type. The control group in Prin et al.'s study consisted of only 10 patients, and the study course was longer. It seems that the highest number of stem cells in different studies was recorded 6 months to 2 years after the injection and therefore our study required a more extended follow-up period.
