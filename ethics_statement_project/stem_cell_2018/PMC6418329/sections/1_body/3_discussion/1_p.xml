<p>In the present study, cardiac function, clinical condition and QoL of patients with chronic HF and reduced EF were studied and compared in two group â€“ medical therapy and medical therapy plus stem cell therapy. No meaningful difference was observed in the demographic characteristics and EF between the two groups except for sex at the beginning of the study. Patients' QoL increased significantly after treatment and to a similar level in both groups. Regarding participants' sex, QoL improvement was higher among males. Given the patients' general satisfaction with life, there was no satisfaction in either group before treatment; whereas, after completing the treatment course, general satisfaction of life was significantly higher in the group receiving stem cell therapy.</p>
