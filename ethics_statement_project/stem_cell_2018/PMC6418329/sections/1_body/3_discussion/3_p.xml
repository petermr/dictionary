The Congestive Heart Failure Cardiopoietic Regenerative Therapy (CHART-1) trial aimed to validate cardiopoiesis-based biotherapy in a larger heart failure cohort. Conducted by Bartunek et al., the study showed neutral results regarding composite, including all-cause mortality, worsening heart failure events, and surrogate endpoints like LVEF in HFrEF patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy receiving intramyocardial injections of cardiopoietic cells (MSC; n=120) versus sham procedures (n=151) [
