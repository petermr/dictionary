<p>The patients who were in the group of stem cell therapy underwent bone marrow aspiration in Montaserieh Hospital of Mashhad, Iran. One hundred millimeter fluid was aspirated from their bone marrow and stored in a cool box; it was sent to the Royan Institute in Tehran via air. In the Royan Institute, the samples were precisely examined for a blood infection, and the mononuclear cells of the bone marrow were extracted by centrifugation. The samples were then returned to Mashhad. On the first morning after receiving the samples, the patients underwent coronary angiography, and 5cc cells consisting of 6 to 8 million mononuclear cells were injected via a microcatheter in the proximal part of the injured coronary artery (which was previously determined by cardiac scan or echocardiography). If no complication occurred, the patients were discharged and follow-ups were done one week and three months later. The researching cardiologist attended all stages of the stem cell infusion and was not blinded for the patients' group.</p>
