<p id="Par67">Glucuronidation is an important way of metabolism for many small endogenous and exogenous lipophilic compounds and is mediated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) located in the endoplasmic reticulum. UGT1A1 is the most abundant member of the UGT1A family in human liver and is also the major isoform responsible for the glucuronidation of bilirubin (UGT1A1 specific), SN-38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan), Î²-estradiol, etc. [

 <italic>UGT1A1*6</italic> and 
 <italic>*28</italic> are two functional polymorphisms that lead to decreased glucuronidation activity. 
 <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic> is characterized by an extra TA repeat (TA-7) in 
 <italic>UGT1A1</italic> promoter that decreases the gene transcription, and SN-38 glucuronidating activity was decreased by approximately 25 and 50%, respectively, in liver microsomes from 
 <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic> heterozygotes and homozygotes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic>UGT1A1*6</italic> is a missense variant that results in decreased UGT1A1 activity by about 50% as indicated by bilirubin and SN-38 glucuronidation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and the variant is primarily observed in the Asians. Clinical studies have shown that the two polymorphisms were associated with increased risk of Gilbert's syndrome or irinotecan-reduced toxicity in Caucasians and Asians [
