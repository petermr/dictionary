<p id="Par58">Peripheral venous blood samples were collected into EDTA-anticoagulate tubes. Genomic DNA was extracted using a E.Z.N.A.
 <sup>®</sup> SQ Blood DNA Kit II (Omega Bio-Tek, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and stored at − 80 °C until use. Genotyping of 
 <italic>UGT1A1</italic> polymorphisms was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and pyrosequencing as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Briefly, The DNA fragments flanking the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic> or 
 <italic>*6</italic> polymorphisms were amplified using Mastercycler (Eppendorf, Germany) in a final reaction volume of 50 µl, which contained 2 µl DNA, 5 µl PCR buffer, 1.5 µl dNTP, 0.5 ul DNA polymerase, 0.05 nM of each amplification primer (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1), and 40 μl sterile double-distilled water. The thermal cycling of PCR was used as follows: degeneration at 94 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C or 66 °C for 30 s respectively, and 72 °C for 30 s; and a final extension 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR products were verified by agarose electrophoresis, followed by pyrosequencing on the PyroMark Q24 Advanced platform (Qiagen, Germany) using PyroMark Reagents (Qiagen, Germany) with the pyrosequencing primer (Additional file
