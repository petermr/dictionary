<p id="Par57">The primary endpoint was drug response, which was categorized as CR or non-CR after the second cycle of the induction chemotherapy according to the criteria of International Working Group AML criteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The criteria of CR was defined as follows: less than 5% blasts and no blasts with Auer rods in the bone marrow, no persistence of extramedullary disease, absolute neutrophil count of &gt; 1×10
 <sup>9</sup>/l and platelets of &gt; 100 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/l, and independent of transfusion. Participants with other treatment outcomes including partial remission, non-remission and TRM after two courses of induction chemotherapy were classified as non-CR group. As mortality tended to be decreased sharply in 4 weeks after the initiation of induction therapy in de novo AML [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], TRM was defined as death within 28 days after initiation of induction therapy. OS was calculated from the date of diagnosis until death from any cause, and EFS was calculated since the date of CR until the date of relapse or death from any cause. Patients who underwent HSCT after achievement of CR were censored at the date of HSCT for OS and EFS. For those patients living or with no evidence of relapse by the end of the study follow-up, time for OS or EFS was censored on the date of the patient's last follow-up [
