<p id="Par59">Comparisons of continuous data between genotype groups were performed by independent Student's T test or Mann–Whitney U test. Fisher's exact test, Continuity correction or Pearson Chi Square test were applied to assess differences in chemotherapy response, toxicity and other clinical information between the genotypes. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to estimate the relative risk of non-CR adjusted for age, risk stratification, and WBC count. The Kaplan–Meier curves were depicted and log-rank test was performed to determine the differences in OS and EFS between/among genotype groups. Hazard ratios for OS and EFS were estimated by Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for potential confounding covariates (including risk stratification, WBC count, and age). All analyses were performed using the SPSS software version 18.0 (IBM Corporation, USA), and the level of statistical significance was defined as
