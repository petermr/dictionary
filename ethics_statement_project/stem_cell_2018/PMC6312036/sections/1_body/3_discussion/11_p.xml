<p>Peripheral blood, but not bone marrow-based MRD status, was highly predictive of PFS and OS in this study (4-year OS of 86.6% for MRD-negative patients compared to 28.6% for MRD-positive patients; (

 </sup> The prognostic impact of MRD in patients treated with the R-BAC500 regimen has not been reported as yet.

 </sup> One avenue of investigation for clarification of these issues will be testing of 'next generation' cellular and molecular methods of MRD detection. Multi-parametric flow cytometry, although requiring very high levels of expertise, has been shown to be feasible and provide satisfactory sensitivity, when compared to highly standardized quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods in MCL.
