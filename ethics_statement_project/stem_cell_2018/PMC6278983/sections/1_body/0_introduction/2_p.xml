<p>Recently, TKI cessation and, thus, treatment-free remission has been established as an important therapeutic goal.

 </sup> However, about 50% of the patients with good response experience a molecular relapse after stopping TKI, pointing towards persisting residual LCs that cannot be controlled by patient-specific immunological mechanisms. As these mechanisms underlying the currently unpredictable individual molecular relapse risk remain controversial, complementary approaches to minimize side-effects associated with continuous TKI therapy are required. While a number of studies evaluate TKI cessation, strategies to apply long-term dose reductions are currently under-appreciated, although the potential benefits of dose de-escalation are at hand: besides reducing treatment-related side-effects and increasing patients' quality of life, it also reduces the treatment-related costs.

 </sup> is an ongoing study addressing TKI dose deescalation. However, with its primary end point (molecular relapse risk after TKI cessation preceded by a one year dose de-escalation) this trial focuses on stopping TKI, rather than on long-term outcomes under continuous but reduced TKI treatment.
