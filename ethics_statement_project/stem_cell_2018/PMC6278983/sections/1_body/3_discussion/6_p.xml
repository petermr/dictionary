<p>Our current model does not consider any immunological effects or other more detailed competition mechanism between LCs and their environment. Therefore, our predictions on the risk of molecular relapse after TKI cessation are solely based on the fraction of LCs at the time of TKI stop and the proliferation rate estimated from CML latency times. This implies that a lower residual LSC number ultimately results in a lower relapse risk. Because of this limitation, our model does not reflect potentially beneficial effects resulting from mildly increased abundance of proliferating LCs which potentially stimulate a patient's immune response.</p>
