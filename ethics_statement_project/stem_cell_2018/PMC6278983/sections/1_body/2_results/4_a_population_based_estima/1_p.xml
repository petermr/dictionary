<p>As pointed out above, the LSC proliferation rate

 </italic>, as an indicator of the 'aggressiveness' of the untreated disease, is intrinsically unknown. In order to circumvent this limitation, we also used a population-based estimate derived from CML latency times, i.e. the time between the first leukemic transformation and diagnosis, given that no secondary events change the kinetics of disease emergence (
