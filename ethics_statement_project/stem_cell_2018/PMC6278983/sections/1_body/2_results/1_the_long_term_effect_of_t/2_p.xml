<p>We obtain an exact solution for the model, in which the patient-specific response can be expressed in terms of the mechanistic model parameters [equation (SE5) in 
 <italic>Online Supplementary Text S2</italic>]. In other words, a patient's bi-phasic 
 <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> decline characterized by the slopes 
 <italic>α</italic>, 
 <italic>β</italic> is expressed in terms of the resulting net cytotoxic effect 
 <italic>q</italic>=

  <sub>TKI</sub>

 <italic>p
  <sub>Y</sub>
 </italic> (difference between TKI toxicity and LSC proliferation) and the effects of LSC activation/deactivation 
 <italic>p
  <sub>XY</sub>
 </italic> and 
 <italic>p
  <sub>YX</sub>
 </italic>. Taking into account the intrinsic scaling between the mechanistic parameters (

 <italic>α</italic> and 
 <italic>β</italic> can be further simplified, allowing us to dissect the prominent processes governing each treatment phase (
