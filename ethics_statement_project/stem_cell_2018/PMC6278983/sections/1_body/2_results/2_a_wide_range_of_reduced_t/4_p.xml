 </italic>. For the median parameters of the available dataset, the optimal favorable reduction fraction is 
 <italic>f
  <sub>OPT</sub>
 </italic> =0.247, and corresponds to a long-term treatment efficiency of 98.4% compared to the standard dose. Therefore, for the 'median patient' in our analysis, a reduction to 24.7% of the original dose would lead to a marginal decrease of only 1.6% in the long-term treatment efficiency, given that a minimal required plasma concentration for TKI cytotoxicity is maintained.
