<p>Due to the bounded activation of quiescent LSCs after the initial therapy response, there is a range of favorable reduced TKI doses where the long-term efficiency (defined by the magnitude of slope 
 <italic>β</italic>) remains almost constant with the same overall efficiency as that achieved when applying the standard dose (green region in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1031825">Figure 2A</xref>, and 
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S3</italic>). In this case, the resulting, although reduced, cytotoxic TKI effect is still sufficient to target the abundant proliferating LSCs once a patient has reached sustained remission. This range of ‘favorable’ reduced doses spans from the standard full-dose to a certain threshold, i.e. an ‘optimal favorable’ dose (green dashed line in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1031825">Figure 2A</xref>), below which an accelerated decrease in long-term treatment efficiency is observed. Therefore, dose reductions below this optimal dose are considered as ‘unfavorable’ (red region in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1031825">Figure 2A</xref>).
