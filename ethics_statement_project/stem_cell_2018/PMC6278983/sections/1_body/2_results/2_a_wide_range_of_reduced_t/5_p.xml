<p>Our model predicts transient increases in 
 <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> levels of proliferating LSCs when applying different dose reductions after the first decline, i.e. once a substantial reduction in 
 <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> levels had been achieved (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1031825">Figure 2</xref>). However, for favorable reductions, 
 <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> levels decrease again with the original long-term treatment efficiency (slope 
 <italic>Î²</italic>) after a few months (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1031825">Figure 2B and C</xref>). For the example of a 'median patient', dose reductions at month 36 of treatment will maintain MR3, while 
 <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> levels are predicted to return to their original values at de-escalation after about 20 months (in case of favorable reduction with 
 <italic>f</italic>=0.5) or 58 months (for the optimal favorable reduction with 
 <italic>f</italic>=0.25). Importantly, the transient increase of proliferating LSCs and, therefore, of 
 <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> levels in the PB, does not lead to either relevant differences in the overall response of quiescent LSCs or in the total LSCs population when compared to standard dose (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S4</italic>). Our model also predicts that returning to the full dose regimen at a later point completely restores the original response levels of proliferating LSCs within a few months (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S5</italic>).
