  <p>Step-wise treatment optimization. (A) Step 1: initial treatment with standard dose until the patient shows a clearly identifiable second slope (approx. 18 months) and determination of the bi-exponential parameters (
   <italic>A, B, α, β</italic>). (B) Step 2: reduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) dose by half and continuous monitoring of the treatment response until the new intercept 
   <italic>B</italic>′ can be inferred (approx. 18 months). (C) Step 3: reduction to the optimal dose calculated from values of the identified parameters (
   <italic>A, B, B', α, β</italic>; see main text). (D) The long-term follow up using optimal dose shows that the response to this adaptive treatment adheres to the original slope 
   <italic>β</italic> for the eradication of residual leukemic stem cells (LSCs) as standard dose treatment. Although the adapted treatment leads to a delay in the reduction of 
   <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> levels in proliferating LSCs and, therefore also in the peripheral blood, the treatment dynamics in the residual quiescent LSCs are unaltered while drug intake is drastically reduced.
