<p id="Par32">Preliminary studies have demonstrated the safety of intrathecal MSC administration in rats [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], dogs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], rabbits [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and horses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. MSCs could potentially be administered intrathecally to horses at three different sites: the atlanto-occipital (AO) cisterna [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], the intervertebral space between the first and second cervical vertebrae (C1â€“C2) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and the lumbosacral (LS) space [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Site selection could depend on neuroanatomical localization of lesions (the administration site preferred closest to the lesion), the clinician's expertise, patient cooperation, and pharmacological protocol (e.g., sedation versus general anesthesia) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It is currently unknown whether MSCs administered intrathecally would be able to migrate throughout the subarachnoid space and home to a diseased site. Developing protocols to administer allogeneic MSCs would permit immediate cell therapy in acute and subacute neurological diseases and would eliminate variation in ex vivo expansion that can hinder autologous cell use, especially in older animals and humans [
