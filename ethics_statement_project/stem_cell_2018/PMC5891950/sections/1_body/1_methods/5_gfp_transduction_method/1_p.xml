<p id="Par42">The eGFP/luciferase lentivirus (pCCLc-MNDU3-LUC-PGK-EGFP-WPRE) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] was a gift from Dr. Jan Nolta. Equine MSCs were transduced as previously described for human MSCs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Briefly, equine MSCs were thawed for at least 3 days prior to transduction. Cells were trypsinized, pelleted, resuspended in transduction media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 10 μg/mL protamine sulfate) and plated in a T75 flask. Lentivirus was added to the flask (multiplicity of infection (MOI) = ~ 10) and the cells were incubated overnight. After 24 h, 2 volumes of standard media were added to the flask. Cells were passed and counted 3 days after transduction and again 5 days later. eGFP efficiency was determined by fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry at both time points. Cells were then frozen and/or expanded for injection.
