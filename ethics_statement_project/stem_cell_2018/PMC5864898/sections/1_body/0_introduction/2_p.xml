<p>γδ T cells are innate immune cells expressing a T cell receptor (TCR) consisting of a γ- and a δ-chain, each composed of a variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segment generated by "VDJ recombination.” The random rearrangement of different gene segments creates a high clonal diversity, which is particularly reflected in the junctional regions (CDR3 sequence) of TCR chains. γδ T cells can be classified based on their expressed Vγ or Vδ chains functionality and distribution within the body. The Vγ9JP
 <sup>+</sup>Vδ2
 <sup>+</sup> subset is the main population of γδ T cells within the peripheral blood of most adult healthy individuals (

 <sup>+</sup>Vδ2
 <sup>+</sup> cells are activated through small phosphoantigens, like microbial-derived HMB-PP or host-derived isopentyl pyrophosphate (IPP) (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and are involved in anti-cancer surveillance, pathogen clearance, or inflammatory diseases (

 <sup>+</sup>Vδ2
 <sup>+</sup> cells is largely unknown. Nevertheless, a few studies revealed that these could be stress molecules exposed by virus-infected or tumor cells (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Overall, non-Vγ9JP
 <sup>+</sup>Vδ2
 <sup>+</sup> γδ T cells exert a high degree of antiviral and antitumor activity (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), which is for instance reflected in the expansion of Vδ1
 <sup>+</sup> γδ T cells in response to viral infection in immunocompromised patients, stem cell transplant recipients, and during pregnancy (
