<p>We monitored peripheral γδ T cell repertoires in 10 patients with chronic HCV infections before, during, and after therapy with DAAs and in additional 13 patients at a single time point during therapeutic DAA treatments. All patients had persistent viral infection with the HCV genotype 1 (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> for patients' characteristics). Even though parameters for liver inflammation, such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level, were above normal levels in 4 of 10 patients (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), it is important to note that all patients included in this study had not yet developed liver cirrhosis. After flow cytometric sorting of γδ T cells, the highly diverse CDR3 regions of the TCR γ- and δ-chain were PCR amplified through gene-specific primers and subjected to NGS analysis (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The workflow to analyze multiple samples from 14 healthy controls (HC) and 23 chronic HCV patients is depicted in Figure S1A in Supplementary Material. Flow cytometric analyses showed slightly decreased total γδ T cell frequencies, but a higher percentage of Vγ9
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, in patients with higher ALT levels when compared with HC and chronic HCV patients having low ALT levels (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A,B). NGS of functional Vγ or Vδ chain usage of TCR repertoires (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C,D) further indicated almost no difference of V-chain distributions between HC and chronic HCV patients. Of note, box plots in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D suggest that at least some of the chronic HCV-infected patients had higher peripheral Vδ3
 <sup>+</sup> frequencies and this was independent of ALT levels. To characterize γδ T cell repertoires in more detail, we analyzed the clonal distribution and diversity of TRG and TRD repertoires (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E,F). As observed in previous datasets of HC (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) and as illustrated by three HC of this study and six representative chronic HCV patients with different ALT levels, the 20 most expanded clones collectively made up between 25 and 60% of whole TRG or TRD repertoires (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E,F). Thus, γδ TCR repertoires of chronic HCV patients largely resembled HC and were highly diverse with few expanded clones, that are not necessarily Vγ9JP
 <sup>+</sup> and Vδ2
 <sup>+</sup> (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E,F). All datasets were summarized by depicting the median frequency of top 20 clones and median Shannon index, a parameter used to measure TCR repertoire diversity, and showed no significant differences between the given groups (Figures S2A,B in Supplementary Material). Together, these NGS results indicate that peripheral TRG and TRD repertoires of healthy persons and chronic HCV patients have a similar complexity and clonal composition.
