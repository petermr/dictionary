<p id="Par32">The infusion of 1928zT2 T cells was well tolerated without any immediate adverse effects in these three patients. Strikingly, the size and hypometabolism of the first patient's breast lump was reduced obviously, detected by PET/CT scanning on day 30 after 1928zT2 T cells infusion (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The patient achieved complete remission on day 46 post infusion. Strikingly, the B ultrasound results showed that her breast lump disappeared compared to the baseline (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). PET/CT and B ultrasound restaging exhibited no evidence of relapse at all during the 12-month follow-up (Fig.
