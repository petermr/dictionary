     <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Admission was chosen as the denominator for the primary outcome rather than PDs since reductions in antimicrobial treatment duration (reflected by a reduction in DOT) may induce a reduction of length of stay (LOS). This may have as consequence that DOT per PDs changes little despite a reduction in antibiotic exposure since both the numerator and denominator are reduced.

     <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Qualitative antimicrobial use outcomes will be assessed through manual review of a random selection of charts (at least 50 charts per ward over the 12-month period) by infectious diseases specialists using prespecified criteria for appropriateness. A subselection of charts (about 10% of the sample) will be reviewed independently by two reviewers (blinded to ward assignment) to determine interobserver variability.
