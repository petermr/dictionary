<p>On the fourth calendar day of antimicrobial treatment, a visual electronic alert displayed in the patient's electronic medical chart will remind prescribers to reassess treatment with regard to intravenous-oral switch, de-escalation or stopping therapy. The alert will not be blocking (ie, if the alert is ignored by the prescriber the antimicrobial prescription will remain active), it will, however, continue to be displayed until it is addressed. The re-evaluation of treatment will be self-guided, that is, there will be no decision support guiding treatment adaptation based on patient-specific data such as vital signs, microbiological results or use of other medications. General information useful for re-evaluation, such as intravenous–oral switch criteria, will be provided as infobuttons. If the antimicrobial treatment is continued or modified, prescribers will be asked to reassess the indication (since the indication may change over a course of antimicrobial treatment). If the antimicrobial treatment is modified on calendar day 3, re-evaluation will be assumed to have taken place and no alert will be displayed on day 4.</p>
