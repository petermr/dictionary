<p>When physicians prescribe a systemic antimicrobial agent (including antifungals and antivirals except antiretroviral drugs used for the treatment of HIV) in the CPOE, they will be asked to select whether the treatment is used for empiric treatment, targeted treatment or prophylaxis and to select the main indication of treatment based on a prespecified list of indications linked to an international terminology such as International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th RevisionÂ (ICD-10) and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms. If a treatment recommendation exists in the local guidelines for the given indication and the treatment regimen prescribed deviates from this recommendation, the prescriber will be offered the choice to switch to the guideline-recommended treatment; otherwise prescribers will be asked to provide an 'accountable justification' for the deviation from the guidelines (a predefined list of potential reasons will be provided with the availability to also enter free text). The proposed system ensures that each antibiotic prescription is linked to a retrievable indication, making it possible to assess prescribing quality and to provide specific decision support.</p>
