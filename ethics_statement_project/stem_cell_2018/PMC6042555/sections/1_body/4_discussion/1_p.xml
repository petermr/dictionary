<p>To our knowledge, the COMPASS trial will be one of the first multicentre, cluster randomised controlled trials to assess whether a pragmatic CDSS integrated into the EHR can reduce overall antibiotic use in a diverse setting of hospitals. Our study has several strengths and limitations which are outlined in the article summary. COMPASS addresses many of the limitations of previous studies regarding the impact of CDSS on antimicrobial use in hospitals.
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A limitation of COMPASS is the fact that the combination of different interventions will make it difficult to identify which component is the most effective; this can hopefully be addressed in further research. We believe that COMPASS is innovative in combining relatively new strategies for AMS, such as 'accountable justification' with well-established strategies like audit and feedback leveraging the potentials of the EHR.
