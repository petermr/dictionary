<p>Inappropriate use of antimicrobials in hospitals is one of the key drivers of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and 
 <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infections (CDI). The purpose of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is, by definition, to protect this limited resource and stave off the negative consequences of its inadequate use while at the same time optimising patient outcomes.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> AMS programmes have been implemented in thousands of hospitals around the world, in some areas by legal mandate.
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> While there is increasing evidence that AMS can generally reduce drug costs, AMR and CDI in the hospital setting, we still do not know which particular AMS interventions provide the best and most sustainable improvements in antibiotic prescribing with the best cost-effectiveness.
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref> In particular, many AMS interventions are labour-intensive and require 'manual' assessment of individual situations by dedicated experts such as infectious diseases specialists or pharmacists.
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7–11</xref> This is problematic since it limits interventions to a small proportion of all prescriptions. Moreover, it threatens sustainability, since there are always competing hospital priorities resulting in limited resources for AMS programmes.
