<p>Four females and eight males suffering from ALS were enrolled in the study. The demographic and neurological characteristics of the ALS patients are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijms-19-01312-t001">Table 1</xref>. There were no abnormalities on the laboratory tests at the inclusion to the study. Clinical analysis was performed in 12 patients as described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4-ijms-19-01312">Section 4</xref>. All ALS patients enrolled in this trial were treated once with autologous bone marrow-derived lineage-negative early hematopoietic cell transplantation given intrathecally to the spinal canal and were assessed for therapy safety and for analysis of selected growth factors, cytokines, and miRNA profiles expressed in the blood plasma and cerebral spinal fluid. In our previous studies, we have thoroughly characterized Lin- cells as a heterogeneous population, which consists of precursor, progenitor, and stem cells and lacks mature morphotic blood elements [
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-19-01312" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Of note, inter-individual variability related to the number of Lin- cells isolated from the bone marrow from each ALS patient and subsequently transplanted intrathecally underlines the heterogeneity of the study patients' groups (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijms-19-01312-t001">Table 1</xref>). In three months post-transplantation, 12 patients were retrospectively analyzed in detail as described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4-ijms-19-01312">Section 4</xref>. As a result of such investigation, the whole patient population was divided into two different groups based on the disease course post-transplantation. Group I included six patients who did not decline neurologically after Lin- cells transplantation. In contrast, group II consisted of six patients, who presented deterioration of neurological status despite cellular adjuvant therapy. Then, in the context of the ALS course, further analysis of molecular data was performed separately for both groups and compared together. Initial comparison of the anthropometric parameters between both groups of treated individuals revealed no statistically significant differences (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijms-19-01312-t001">Table 1</xref>). In our study, patients from group II appeared to obtain lower number of Lin- cells per transplantation than individuals from group I.
