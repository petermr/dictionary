<p>The clinical progression of the disease using the Norris scale was assessed at baseline, after 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 12 days (during hospitalization), 18 and 28 days after injection, and three and six months after injection. This scale is a rating scale for ALS and consists of two parts, the limb Norris scale (21 items to evaluate extremity function) and the Norris bulbar scale (13 items to evaluate bulbar function). Each item is rated in four ordinal categories. In addition, activities of daily living using the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale (ALSFRS) were assessed prior to the cell therapy, at discharge from the clinic (day 12), and during subsequent visits. The ALSFRS scale measures a patient’s level of self-sufficiency in four domains with three items in each (rated 4–0 with a maximum score = 48): bulbar function, fine motor tasks, gross motor tasks, and respiratory insufficiency. Based on the functional condition of patients three months after cell injection (assessed using the ALSFRS and Norris scale), we divided them into two groups: I—patients whose condition did not decrease based on results from at least one scale assessment (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6); and II—patients whose condition deteriorated based on results from both neurological tests (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6).
