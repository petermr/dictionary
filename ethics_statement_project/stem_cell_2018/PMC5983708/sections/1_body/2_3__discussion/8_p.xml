<p>Neuroinflammation and glial cell activation have been shown to contribute to motor neuron degeneration in ALS. The upregulation of "inflamma-miRNAs”, also known as "immune-miRs”, including miR-155, was shown to contribute to microglia-mediated immune response and neuroinflammation [

Thus, after Lin- cells administration we defined alterations of miR-155 expression, noticeably important for neuroinflammation-associated signaling pathways in ALS. Interestingly, we found that the significant increase of miR-155 expression levels was a sustained feature only in the blood plasma collected from all ALS patients after Lin- cells transplantation but not in their CSF samples. The constant expression profile of miR-155 in the CSF after cell transplantation might vaguely suggest that the inflammation is not progressing [

On the other hand, there is recent evidence demonstrating that upregulation of miR-155 benefits in preventing the elevation of other pro-inflammatory cytokines. The miR-155 upregulation could be due to the lack of CX3CL1 inhibitory input from neurons, essential for the microglia surveilling phenotype [

 <xref rid="B69-ijms-19-01312" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Therefore, the results of miR-155 expression in our study may provide a potential explanation for the observed significantly lower concentration of pro-inflammatory C3 molecule in the CSF from ALS patients after Lin- cells transplantation.
