<p>Prescreening interview will include a medical history with discussion about willingness to participate in the trial. This will be followed by a clinical assessment that will include a routine examination of the foot and ankle, including: inspection of limb alignment and other biomechanical abnormality such as flat or high arched feet; size and location of swelling over the Achilles tendon and range of motion of the ankles, hindfeet, midfeet and forefeet. Assessment of gastrocnemius tightness will be performed with the knee fully straight and flexed 20 degrees (Silfverskiold test). Examination will aim to rule out other conditions such as an adjacent bursitis or insertional tendinopathy (tenderness over the calcaneal bony attachment). The Simmonds' test will be performed to ensure continuity of the tendon.</p>
