<p>The primary outcome will be safety as defined by the incidence rate of serious adverse reaction (SAR). The secondary outcomes will be efficacy as measured by patient-reported outcome measures. Ultrasound techniques will assess the radiological outcome of the procedure. Computerised 'ultrasound tissue characterisation' (UTC) is also carried out in order to add in a less subjective assessment. UTC involves a precision instrument that moves the ultrasound probe automatically across the long axis of the Achilles tendon collecting transverse images at even distances of 0.2 mm over a length of 12 cm and enable tomographic visualisation and tissue characterisation and quantification of architecture and integrity of the collagenous matrix.</p>
