<p>To test clinical applicability, a decision tree was developed to classify patients into the seven clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-1040189">Figure 3</xref>). The decision tree was based on expert physicians' interpretation of the organs that were found together in the machine-learning workflow. The decision tree was constructed through observation of viSNE scatter plots and MEM labels from the clusters of patients identified by the machine learning (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1040189">Figures 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1040189">2A</xref>). Patients' outcomes were not considered in developing the decision tree. This decision tree asks a series of seven questions and can phenotype patients in as few as one question for patients in Cluster 7.
