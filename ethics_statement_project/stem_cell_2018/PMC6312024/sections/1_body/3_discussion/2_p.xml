<p>The process of applying this computational workflow to chronic GvHD patients yielded clinically applicable insights. Training analyses revealed that symptom-based lung score did not contribute to clustering and that cluster stability was improved without the lung score (

 <italic>S3</italic>). In the NIH symptom-based lung score, a score from 0-3 is assigned based on the degree of activity needed to cause dyspnea with a requirement for oxygen being scored 3.

 </sup> The fact that this symptom-based lung score did not contribute to patient clustering may be due to the subjective nature of the score and suggests that it reflects overall well-being rather than organ-specific involvement. However, it is important to note that the NIH symptom-based lung score has been associated with patients’ outcomes, including non-relapse mortality and overall survival, in an analysis that also included chronic GvHD Consortium patients.
