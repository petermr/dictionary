<p>Disease trajectory differed in the decision-tree-identified clusters, most notably for Clusters 2, 6 and 7. The time from stem cell transplantation to development of chronic GvHD was different in Cluster 2, a sclerotic phenotype. This is a clinically relevant and potentially biologically distinct cluster of patients. Longer time to chronic GvHD development is a known clinical finding in patients with sclerotic chronic GvHD.

 </sup> Previous work defined patients with sclerotic chronic GvHD as having at least one of the following: sclerosis, fascia or joint involvement.

 </sup> This literature did not comment on the sclerotic phenotype as one with “de-enrichment” of liver and mouth involvement or take into account the combination of multiple sclerotic features.
