<p>Groups identified by the decision tree continued to stratify survival, with patients in the intermediate-risk group having a 1.8-fold higher risk of mortality compared to those in the low-risk group and patients in the high-risk group having a 2.8-fold higher risk of mortality. Individual high-risk clusters, i.e., Clusters 6 and 7, also independently stratified overall survival when identified by the decision tree. Importantly, the decision tree stratified risk of mortality independently of previously defined risk factors for chronic GvHD, including NIH-Severity. Notably, platelet count was a risk factor that continued to stratify risk significantly. Overall, the decision tree has the potential to be applied in the clinical setting to assess patients' phenotypes, once further validation in prospective, independent cohorts has been completed. Additionally, this decision tree can be applied in the research setting to large cohorts of patients.</p>
