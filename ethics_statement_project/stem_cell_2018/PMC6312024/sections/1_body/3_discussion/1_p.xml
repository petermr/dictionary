<p>Seven unique chronic GvHD patients' phenotypes were revealed through a machine-learning workflow and successfully recapitulated with a clinically applicable decision-tree tool. The revealed groups of patients were stratified for overall survival and a unique sclerotic phenotype with different time from stem cell transplantation to development of chronic GvHD was found. The clusters of patients we describe may overcome the limitations of the current NIH classification system of disease severity which does not account for combinations of organ involvement and did not stratify survival in this cohort.</p>
