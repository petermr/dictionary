<p>Choosing the correct cells for transplantation is a critical issue for successful clinical translation in stem cell therapy. In this study, we used the allogeneic human UCB‐derived MSCs from the same 6th passage as in our previous phase I clinical trial for BPD, approved by both Korean 
 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> and United States Food and Drug Administrations (NCT02381366). These cells, manufactured in strict compliance with criteria for good manufacturing practice, were transplanted into premature infants with severe IVH. Allogeneic transplantation of MSCs may have a logistic advantage because they are ready to use "off the shelf” in the clinical setting. Moreover, UCB‐derived MSCs exhibit several advantages over adult tissue‐derived MSCs including lower immunogenicity

 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref> and higher proliferation capacity, paracrine potency, and therapeutic efficacy both in vitro

 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> and in vivo 
 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref>. These MSCs show karyotypic stability and no senescence up to the 11th passage. No transplantation‐related adverse effects, including tumorigenicity, were observed at 70 days post‐transplantation in rats

 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>, after intratracheal administration of MSCs. Taken together; these findings suggest that human UCB‐derived MSCs might be appealing choice of cells for transplantation into preterm infants with severe IVH.
