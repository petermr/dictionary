<p>For determination of sample size, we used a "3 + 3” cohort design with an expansion cohort of six patients at the next highest dose. Therefore, a minimum of nine patients, in total, was needed to establish the safety profile of this phase I study. The first three patients were assigned to receive a low dose of MSCs (5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/kg), and the next six patients were assigned to receive a high dose of MSCs (1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> cells/kg).
