  <p>Baseline levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokines and growth factors. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Baseline levels of CSF cytokines and growth factors were grouped and compared with those of infants who received shunt placement. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. The correlations between initial brain ventricular index including anterior horn width ratio 
   <bold>(C)</bold> and 
   <bold>(E)</bold> and ventricular width ratio 
   <bold>(B)</bold> and 
   <bold>(D)</bold> measured with cranial ultrasonogram and the baseline levels of IL‐6 and TNF‐α are shown, respectively. Abbreviations: BDNF, brain‐derived neurotropic factor; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; IL, interleukin;
