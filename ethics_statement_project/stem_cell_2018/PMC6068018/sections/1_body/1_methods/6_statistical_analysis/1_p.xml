<p>The primary study end point was to determine the safety and toxicity of this novel treatment regimen combining decitabine and plerixafor. The secondary clinical end points included overall response rate and overall survival. Overall survival was measured in months from cohort assignment to date of death or last followup date. The overall response rate (ORR) calculation included CR, CRi and PR. Descriptive statistics (i.e. median, range, frequency, and percent) were calculated to characterize the study population. Overall survival (OS) was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and univariate associations between demographic/clinical variables of interest and OS were assessed by the log-rank test. The independent effect of demographic/clinical predictors of interest on OS was assessed by multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were computed and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for hazard ratios and median OS time estimates are presented to assess the precision of the obtained estimates. Median follow-up time for the study group was computed based on survivors. Associations between demographic/clinical variables of interest and overall response were evaluated by the Ï‡
