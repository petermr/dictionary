<p>The trial was designed as an open-label, phase I feasibility study to optimize mobilization of leukemia stem and progenitor cells using a fixed dose and schedule of decitabine combined with escalating doses of plerixafor. Based on previous data, it was expected that patients would require between 1-4 10-day cycles of decitabine to achieve clinical response. Plerixafor was administered during alternating treatment cycles, which allowed each patient to serve as his/her own "control‚Äù for measurements of mobilization and other correlative scientific studies. Half of the patients received plerixafor during odd-numbered treatment cycles, and half during even-numbered cycles, as the optimal timing of plerixafor administration was unknown.</p>
