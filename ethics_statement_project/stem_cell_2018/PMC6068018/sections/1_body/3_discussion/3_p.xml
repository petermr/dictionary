<p>While this trial was designed to optimize acquisition of clinically relevant, correlative scientific data, the design may not have optimized the antileukemic effects of the plerixafor/decitabine combination, since patients received plerixafor only every other cycle and for only half of the decitabine doses (5 of 10 doses). At the trial outset, we were uncertain as to the optimal dose and schedule of plerixafor, and concerned about its potential for inducing leukocytosis. These issues led to a treatment design in which plerixafor was administered either during even numbered or odd-numbered cycles for each dosing cohort, with the objective of using each patient as his/her own control. Mobilization may have been enhanced by additional days of dosing, or by concomitant administration of G-CSF, as recommended for plerixafor’s FDA-approved indication.</p>
