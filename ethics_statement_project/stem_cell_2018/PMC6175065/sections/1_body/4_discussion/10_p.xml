<p>Patient‐reported HR‐QoL has been considered an important endpoint for patients with MM (Kvam &amp; Waage, 
 <xref rid="bjh15459-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), giving the patient input on the effects of treatment (Delforge 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bjh15459-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). The results of this study showed that improvements in clinical outcomes were not at the detriment of patient reported HR‐QoL. The findings are reassuring in the context of continuing development of sequential treatment for induction, consolidation and maintenance. However, such large‐scale studies, this being the largest to date, are a major undertaking and very unlikely to be given priority in future studies. Indeed, it could be that more sensitive QoL instruments, or potentially instruments focussed on specific domains, for example neurological, will be required to identify clinically relevant differences between treatment combinations. In the context of current trends in treatment with combinations of immunomodulatory agents, proteasome inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies and HDAC inhibitors, be it in modules of intensification as consolidation intended to achieve MRD negativity, sequential, multi‐agent treatment as longer term "maintenance”, or both, there will be a need to monitor the impact on patients' QoL. New standardised, ideally simplified, approaches that consider specific side effects of given agents as well as key QoL measures should be explored.
