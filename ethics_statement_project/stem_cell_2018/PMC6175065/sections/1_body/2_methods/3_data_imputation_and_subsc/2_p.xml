<p>The total number of imputed datasets was determined as the maximum percentage of 'missingness' in a compulsory question at any time point, or baseline measurement [stratification factors, age, sex and International Staging System (ISS)] across the three populations. For each population, imputation was conducted in temporal order, therefore the baseline measurements were imputed first, followed by baseline questionnaire values, then the 3 months questionnaire values and so on. Within each time point, the variables were imputed in order of least to most missing. Note that only questionnaires from the treatment period being considered were used within each imputation phase: for example, only induction questionnaires from non‐intensive pathway patients were used to impute data for the non‐intensive pathway.</p>
