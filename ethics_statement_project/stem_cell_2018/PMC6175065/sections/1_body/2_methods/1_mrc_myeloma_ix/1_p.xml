<p>Myeloma IX recruited patients with newly‐diagnosed MM aged ≥18 years from 120 centres in the United Kingdom between 2003 and 2007 and was registered with the appropriate organisation (ISRCTN68454111). All 120 centres reviewed the protocol and all recruited participants gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, with an opt‐in component for the QoL sub‐study. The study was an open‐label randomised, phase III trial with a factorial design in which there were two randomisations. The first included randomised allocation of patients to receive a bisphosphonate (sodium clodronate or zoledronic acid) and induction treatment, either intensive or non‐intensive, determined by the treating clinicians' assessments in combination with patient performance status and preferences following informed discussion. In the intensive pathway, patients were randomised to receive cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (CVAD) or oral cyclophosphamide, thalidomide and dexamethasone (CTD) followed by high dose melphalan plus autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). In the non‐intensive pathway, the randomisation was to attenuated CTD (CTDa) or melphalan and prednisolone (MP). A further randomisation allocated patients to either thalidomide maintenance therapy or observation only. Details of the trial, including the randomisation methods and sample size calculation, have been published elsewhere together with results of primary and secondary endpoints related to treatment effectiveness and safety (Morgan
