<p>The CONSORT diagrams show the questionnaire return rate by allocated treatment group (Fig 
 <xref rid="bjh15459-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The return rate and completeness of the questionnaires were generally good with a lower return rate at baseline (20% missing baseline questionnaires in both the intensive and non‐intensive pathways and 44% missing in the maintenance phase). In the intensive pathway, the CVAD group had a fairly constant rate of ‘missingness’, which contrasted with the CTD group where a large discrepancy was observed at 4 years (CVAD: 16% missing, CTD: 24% missing). In the non‐intensive pathway, a similar proportion of questionnaires were returned in both groups at each time point with the exception of 12 months post‐randomisation (MP: 13% missing, CTDa: 24% missing). In the maintenance phase, the return rate improved after the low return rate at baseline, with only approximately 10% of questionnaires missing up to 3 years post‐randomisation. The highest percentage of total ‘missingness’ not relating to a conditional question was 63%, 71% and 48% for the intensive and non‐intensive pathways and maintenance phase, respectively. Thus 71 imputed datasets were created for each analysis population.
