<p id="p0115">The study consisted of two 4-week periods (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In the first (part 1), a dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety of JR-141 administered to two patients by intravenous infusion at four dosage levels (0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg/week) was carried out. In the second 4-week period (part 2), a randomized study was done to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and exploratory efficacy of JR-141 administered by intravenous infusion at 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg/week (six patients in each dosage group). In all patients, idursulfase was switched to JR-141 without a washout period. Appropriate amounts of JR-141 were diluted with normal saline and infused intravenously once a week. The duration of infusions was 3 hr or longer, depending on the general conditions of the patients and the investigators’ discretion. After completion of the study, all patients restarted conventional enzyme-replacement therapy with idursulfase. The study period was defined as the time from the initiation of the first infusion of JR-141 until 1 week after the last administration.
