<p id="p0095">Although this study was merely for 4 weeks and not designed to establish the efficacy of JR-141 via clinically validated measures, it may be noteworthy that two of the investigators reported some brief motor and behavioral changes in their respective patients. One 16-year-old patient in the low-dose group was reported to have learned to skip, an activity he had never attempted before, while the other, a 14-year-old in the high-dose group, showed improved gait, continence, sleep, and responsiveness toward those around him. There were notable reductions in CSF HS level from 5,840 to 3,650 ng/mL in the former, 8,940 to 2,720 ng/mL in the latter. These improvements all disappeared several weeks after administration of the test drug ceased, as documented in the patients' medical records. Albeit merely anecdotal, these clinical observations may be useful for future clinical trials in monitoring subtle neurocognitive and behavioral changes that can be easily overlooked.</p>
