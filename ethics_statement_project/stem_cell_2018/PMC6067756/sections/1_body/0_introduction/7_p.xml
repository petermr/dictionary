<p>Other forms of wildlife fertility control vaccines have adopted comparable initial and booster recommendations [

 <xref rid="pone.0201570.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, this intensive vaccination schedule places significant logistical barriers on application in free-ranging animals. GonaCon vaccine is formulated with highly immunostimulating mycobacteria as a component of the adjuvant. This may prolong the initial and subsequent booster vaccination windows for optimum efficacy as initial antibody concentrations are maximal 2–12 months post-primary vaccination [
 <xref rid="pone.0201570.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. GonaCon vaccine is one of the rare exceptions among animal vaccines in that the formulation initiates high antibody titers that remain elevated in some individuals after a single-injection; however, little research has been conducted to evaluate booster doses of this vaccine in any free-ranging wild ungulate [

 <xref rid="pone.0201570.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or domestic species [
 <xref rid="pone.0201570.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. While a single immunization against GnRH may be preferred from a practical perspective, there may be a more optimal vaccination schedule that balances the need for minimizing animal handling or contact while maximizing vaccine effectiveness. Thus, it's imperative to investigate the safety and long-term effectiveness of repeat vaccination and to evaluate its potential to limit fertility in this long-lived and perennially pregnant species.
