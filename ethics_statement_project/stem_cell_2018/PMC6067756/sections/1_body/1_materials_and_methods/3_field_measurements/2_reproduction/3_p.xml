<p>Each year of the study, we estimated annual foaling proportions by locating all bands to identify individual mares and determine the presence or absence of foals. During the intensive sampling period (1 March–1 August), we attempted to observe 95% or greater of all experimental mares and foals (when present) at least weekly and 100% of them every two weeks, then opportunistically until 31 December. We did not attempt to assess contraceptive effect based on visual characteristics of pregnancy but did use these criteria to prioritize weekly observations of individual mares. Instead, we defined foaling as a parturition event or neonatal foal by side, as detected by direct observation. We matched foals with dams through observations of nursing and repeated close association during feeding, bedding, and traveling [

We photographed and estimated the age of each new foal when first observed, recorded its sex, general health (vigorous, average, poor), markings, and band association, and gave it a unique identifier; then entered these observations into a herd database. Finally, we assessed the utility of using foaling proportions as a proxy for pregnancy proportions by comparing pregnancy proportions determined at the time of each gather in 2009 and 2013 to foaling proportions observed in 2010 and 2014.
