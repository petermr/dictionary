<p>Besides feral horses, sympatric wild ungulate species include bison, elk, mule deer (
 <italic>Odocoileus hemionus)</italic>, white-tailed deer, and pronghorn (
 <italic>Antilocapra americana)</italic>. Horses and bison are confined to the South Unit of the Park by a 1.8–2.4 m woven-wire boundary fence. Currently, horse numbers are controlled through periodic live capture and removal of select individuals. Free-ranging horses at THRO are classified by the National Park Service (NPS) as "feral livestock” and managed as a "historical demonstration herd”. The most recent estimate of population size (2017) is 150–175 horses and the Park has set a management goal for this herd at approximately 50–90 animals.
