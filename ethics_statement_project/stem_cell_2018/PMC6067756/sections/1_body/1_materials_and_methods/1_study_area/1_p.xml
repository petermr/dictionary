<p>We conducted this research in the South Unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park (THRO), USA) (45° 55'N/103° 31'W). This unit is located near the town of Medora in southwestern North Dakota and encompasses approximately 19,000 ha of native vegetation. The landscape is topographically diverse and consists of eroded badlands with gullies and ravines separated by relatively large upland plateaus and small erosion-resistant buttes capped by scoria. Elevation ranges from 683 m to 870 m. Its continental climate is characterized by short, arid summers (mean temperature 21
 <sup>0</sup> C) and long, cold winters (mean temperature -12
 <sup>0</sup> C) [
