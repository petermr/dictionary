<p>We used descriptive statistics (arithmetic means with ± 95% CI) to compare, occurrence of lesions at the injection site and 1-tailed Fisher’s exact test (α = 0.05, 1df) to compare foal survival proportions of treated females to that of controls. We used normal binomial distributions to compute confidence limits for the differences between proportions using Jeffrey’s interval for small sample sizes [
