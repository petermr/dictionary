<p>Cytological and histological sections were performed in Regenerative Medicine Laboratory of Jinan University for expert assistance in preparing. The rats (Sprague-Dawley) (250–300 g) were anesthetized with 3% pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg) and then underwent surgery consisting of a lower abdominal midline incision and bilateral resection of the inguinal fat pads for culture ADSCs. A specimen of inguinal fat was harvested and placed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The adipose tissue was rinsed with PBS, minced into small pieces, and then incubated in a solution containing 0.1% collagenase type I (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 30 minutes at 37°C with shaking (100 rounds every minute). The top lipid layer was removed, and the remaining liquid portion was centrifuged at 1000
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes at room temperature to obtain the stromal cell fraction. The pellet was filtered with a 100-μm mesh filter to remove the debris. The filtrate was treated with 0.3% NaCl for 10 minutes to lyse red blood cells and centrifuged at 300
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes. The supernatant was discarded, and the remaining cells were suspended in Dulbecco modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, Logan, Utah), and plated in a 25-cm
 <sup>2</sup> bottle and cultured at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The primary cells were cultured for 6 to 7 days until they reached confluence and were defined as "passage 0.” Adipose-derived stem cells were cultured and expanded in control medium and used for the experiments at passages 3 to 5.
