<p id="Par93">Patients' clinical status was assessed according to CCS and NYHA classes, nitrate consumption and disease-related questionnaires at baseline and 6 and 12 months post procedure. Of importance, a significant improvement in the CCS angina class was noted during the follow-up period (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001) in 8 out of 10 patients. In two diabetic patients, no angina symptoms were present at accrual. In particular, the CCS class was observed to be markedly reduced from 3.0 ± 0.5 at baseline to 1.4 ± 0.5 at 6 months (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001) and to 1.6 ± 0.5 at 12 months (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Notably, the patient percentage showing a ≥ 2 class improvement was 50% at 6 months and 37.5% at 12 months. In parallel, the NYHA class significantly improved during the 12-month study period (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.007; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Moreover, the nitrate consumption per week progressively decreased during the study period from 4 (2–7) to 0.25 (0.04–4) at 6 months and 0.04 (0–2) at 12 months (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), with a significant difference in nitrate consumption at 12 months with respect to baseline (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001).
