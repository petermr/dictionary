<p id="Par82">Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± SD or median (interquartile range (IQR)), as appropriate. A within-subject Student's 
 <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare baseline and 6-month follow-up data. To evaluate differences in the distribution of continuous data at baseline, 6-month and 12-month follow-up, one-way ANOVA or the Friedman test for repeated measures were performed with Bonferroni or Dunn's post-hoc analysis, respectively. Correlations between continuous variables were assessed by Pearson or Spearman test, as appropriate.
