The trial was performed at two investigational sites: Centro Cardiologico Monzino-IRCCS (Milan, Italy) as the coordinating and recruiting center, and Città della Salute e della Scienza Hospital (Turin, Italy) as the recruiting center. The institutional review board at each center approved the protocol and all patients gave informed consent prior to participation. Patients were excluded in the case of denial and might withdraw from the study at any time, irrespective of the reason. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethical committees (CCFM225/612 and CS/154) and the Italian Competent Authority (Istituto Superiore di Sanità, 15,934(13)PRE21-1199).
