<p id="Par58">The study design comprised a screening phase in which patients were checked for inclusion/exclusion criteria and post-procedure follow-up visits scheduled at 6 and 12 months, as safety and efficacy endpoints (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Specifically, the baseline screening assessment was performed within 2 months before the injection procedure and included: clinical evaluation as Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes, concomitant medications, patients' quality of life and health status; single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT); cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET); two-dimensional (2D) echocardiogram; cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) when applicable; Holter ECG monitoring; and blood tests. The patients' quality of life and health status were evaluated using the Short Form-12 (SF-12) survey and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ). In particular, the SF-12 survey consists of two parts—the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS)—while the MLHFQ is a 21-question tool to test patients' perception of the impact of HF.
