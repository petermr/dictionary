<p id="Par104">Several differences have to be taken into account when interpreting such mixed results. Although both the PROGENITOR and REGENT-VSEL trials randomized RA patients vs controls/placebo, whereas the RECARDIO trial did not, these studies were underpowered to detect perfusion differences. However, additional variables may also play a major role. One of the most relevant is probably the level of the ischemic burden. Rodrigo et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] identified the large number of myocardial segments at baseline as an independent predictor of a significant improvement in perfusion, and Wojakowski et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] recognized that the inclusion of patients with a low number of baseline ischemic segments might have influenced their results (3.6 ± 2.7 in the REGENT-VSEL trial vs 7.3 ± 2.2 in the RECARDIO trial). Along the same line, it is likely that the higher angina class, the better the likelihood of improvement, as reflected by the nearly identical and significant 6-month reduction of CCS class that the RECARDIO and PROGENITOR studies have observed, having included patients with mean CCS ≥ 3 at baseline. It is worth mentioning that our findings of a remarkable sustained angina benefit are perfectly in line with a consistent body of previous RCT and meta-analyses confirming clinical efficacy of BM or PB intramyocardial progenitor cell injection in RA patients [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. One can expect that perfusion and symptom changes may correlate with LV and patients' functional amelioration. However, this correlation was not evenly observed in previous studies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], probably reflecting the heterogeneous nature of this patient population.
