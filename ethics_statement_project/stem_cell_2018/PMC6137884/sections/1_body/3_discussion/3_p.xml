<p id="Par101">Of importance, CT by means of catheter-based intramyocardial cell delivery has emerged as a viable and promising therapy. Different BM or PB-derived autologous vasculogenic cell populations, including unfractioned mononuclear cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and positively selected CD34 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] or CD133 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] cells, have been injected into ischemic areas to ameliorate perfusion of LV territories not otherwise amenable to revascularization. Large meta-analyses have concordantly suggested that CT has an overall favorable effect in symptom relief and exercise capacity improvement in "no option‚Äù patients with RA [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Moreover, a decreased incidence of MACE and arrhythmias in cell-treated patients has been observed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Of note, the transcatheter intramyocardial approach appears to compare favorably to intracoronary infusion in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and LV dysfunction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Very recently, a large patient-level pooled analysis of RCT including 304 RA patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] has demonstrated consistent and durable improvements in exercise capacity, angina frequency and mortality after intramyocardial injection of autologous CD34
