<p id="Par55">Our group has pioneered the feasibility and safety of direct intramyocardial delivery of BM-derived CD133
 <sup>+</sup> progenitors when injected epicardially through a minimally invasive approach in the context of a "no-option‚Äù RA population [

 <sup>+</sup> cells as an autologous advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP-CD133) in the cardiovascular scenario [
