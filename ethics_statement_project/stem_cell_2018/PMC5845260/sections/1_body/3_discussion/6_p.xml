<p id="Par36">In general, QOL for patients with MS is diminished by physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms and comorbidities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, subjects enrolled in this study reported consistent improvements in their RAND 36 SF QOL in these areas, particularly at the 1-month evaluation (p &lt; 0.001). Most categories improved at 1 month, and then slipped slightly at the 1 year evaluation period while still remaining improved over baseline, suggesting that treatment frequency greater than once annually could further improve the treatment subject's QOL outlook.
