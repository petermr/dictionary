<p id="Par17">UCMSC in this study were produced by MediStem Panama Inc. UCMSC were isolated from afterbirth tissue obtained after full-term, healthy births, donated by consenting mothers. After screening for infection and contamination, UCMSC were obtained from enzymatic digestion of Wharton's Jelly tissue after a primary culture process at 37 °C, 5% CO2 during 24 h. Cells were expanded using alpha-MEM (Gibco Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), supplemented with 10% FBS (USFDA approved, Gibco Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and 4 mM GlutaMax (Gibco Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) in triple flasks under normoxic conditions. Cells were assessed between passages two and three for meeting MSC criteria and absence of contamination. Each enzymatic digestion step was considered to be a passage. Cells were harvested after 5 passages (3–4 weeks after initiation of primary culture). MediStem Panama used the minimal criteria established by the Mesenchymal and Tissue Stem Cell Committee of International Society for Cellular Therapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Each lot was tested for sterility (fungus, mycoplasma, aerobes and anaerobes), endotoxin level below 3 EU/ml, and viability after thawing higher than 75%. The approved cells expressed surface molecules CD105, CD73 and CD90, and lacked expression of CD45 and CD34, as determined by flow cytometry. UCMSC were also tested for differentiation into adipocytes, chondroblasts, and osteoblasts in vitro using StemPro
 <sup>®</sup> media, and stained with oil red, alcian blue and alizarin red, respectively. Approved cells were suspended in a dextrose and saline solution for subsequent administration.
