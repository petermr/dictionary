<p id="Par16">To generate synthetic data, we used multiple imputation models and, more precisely, data augmentation methods developed by Schafer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and Little and Rubin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. We generated a dataset of 1000 virtual subjects from the available patients’ data (
 <italic>n</italic> = 105) with Bayesian multiple imputation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. We also performed Chi-square tests for categorical variables and 
 <italic>t</italic> tests for continuous variables to assess if the synthetic data were representative for our database. To assess the performance and the robustness of the tree-augmented Naïve (TAN) Bayes algorithm, we compared it to four other methods: logistic regression, Naïve Bayes, SVM, and random forest. The criteria retained for comparison were the area under the curve of the receiving operator characteristics curve (AUC-ROC), the percentage of incorrect patient classification, the positive predictive value, and the negative predictive value, both on training data and after a ten-fold cross-validation.
