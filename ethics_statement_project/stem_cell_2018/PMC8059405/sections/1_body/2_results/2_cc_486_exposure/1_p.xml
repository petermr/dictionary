<p id="P26">The median number of CC-486 treatment cycles for all patients was 9.0 (range, 1 to 12) (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Median duration of treatment was 252.5 days (range, 3 to 371). Thirteen patients (43%) completed all 12 treatment cycles, including 1 of 7 patients (14%) in the combined 7-day dosing group and 12 of 23 patients (52%) in the combined 14-day group. Among the 17 patients (57%) who discontinued treatment before completing 12 cycles, median time to discontinuation was 283.5 days (range, 21 to 401). Reasons for discontinuation included MDS or AML relapse (n = 6, 20% of all patients), withdrawal of consent (n = 5, 17%), GVHD (n = 2, 7%), non-GVHD TEAEs (n = 2, 7%), death (n = 1, 3%), or "other” (n = 1, 3%). "Other” involved a patient in the CC-486 300-mg 7-day dosing arm who had a history of central nervous system leukemia at study entry and was receiving intrathecal methotrexate before and during CC-486 treatment. Because of presentation of central nervous system features characteristic of a transient ischemic attack and suspected central nervous system relapse at cycle 4, as well as administration of radiation therapy, the patient was discontinued because of risk of bleeding. The patient was in CR at all evaluations after discontinuing therapy, was not included in an on-study relapse rate, and was alive and in CR at the end of the study according to bone marrow aspirate samples.
