<p id="P37">Once-daily CC-486 was generally well tolerated; the MTD was not reached in this study, and there was no meaningful difference in the frequency or severity of AEs among dosing regimens. The most common TEAEs were gastrointestinal and hematologic, consistent with previous reports of low-dose s.c. azacitidine post-transplant and of front-line CC-486 in MDS and AML [

 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Rate of discontinuation due to TEAEs was low, with most discontinuations due to MDS or AML relapse (20% of all patients). Patients undergoing alloSCT are particularly vulnerable to myelosuppression and other toxicities [

 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Despite the pharmacokinetic testing protocol, investigators and patients may have been reluctant to forego the patients' prescribed concomitant medications in the post-transplant setting. Nevertheless, these data, albeit in a small patient sample, suggest a lack of significant drug–drug interactions with CC-486 and standard concomitant medications such as antibiotics or drugs to manage gastrointestinal events.
