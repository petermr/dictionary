<p id="Par2">High-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has become the standard of care for patients with relapsed and/or high-risk non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) ever since clinical trials have shown a benefit over standard chemotherapy in terms of progression-free and overall survival [

However, 10–25% of NHL patients fail to achieve sufficient stem cell yields to proceed to transplantation with current mobilization regimens. These patients either undergo further mobilization attempts or receive alternative treatment options, requiring additional health care resources. In addition, mobilization failure impacts treatment outcome; in a retrospective study it was found that the three-year survival rate was 33% in poor mobilizers (CD34+ &lt; 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/kg) as compared to 71% in patients mobilizing adequately [
