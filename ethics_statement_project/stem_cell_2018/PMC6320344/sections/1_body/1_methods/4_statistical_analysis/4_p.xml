<p id="Par16">For categorical data, differences between eras were evaluated using McNemar's test for matched pairs. For continuous data, difference scores were calculated by subtracting the value for each plerixafor era patient from the value of his/her matched controlled. If the difference score was normally distributed, statistical significance was assessed using the paired 
 <italic>t</italic>-test. If the data was not normally distributed, the Wilcoxon signed rank test was used instead. Normality of each distribution was determined using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
