<p>A limitation of the study is its retrospective nature and the lack of data from recent years during which different regimens have been used and novel therapies have become available. For example, part of the study was performed before bendamustine was introduced as first-line treatment in CLL and before a CD20 antibody was added to CLB. For a more complete understanding of real-world outcome in CLL patients, an analysis of the outcome of treatment of relapse is warranted. As this requires a longer follow up, we have started a separate project for further investigation. Despite these limitations, in relation to today's standard-of-care treatment, the results are still important.</p>
