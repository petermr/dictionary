<p id="Par54">Patients in the BTH1677 and Control arms were dosed in 3-week cycles. On Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle, patients in the BTH1677 arm were administered 4 mg/kg of BTH1677 intravenously (IV) over 2 to 4 h (depending on patient weight and total dose administered). On Day 1 of each cycle, patients in each arm were administered 15 mg/kg of bevacizumab IV over 90 min. In the BTH1677 arm, bevacizumab was administered after BTH1677. On Day 2 of each cycle, IV carboplatin (dosed according to Calvert formula area under the curve [AUC] of 6 mg/mL•min over 30 min) and IV paclitaxel (200 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> over 3 h) were administered to all patients. No dosing occurred on Day 8 and Day 15 of the Control arm. Prior to each BTH1677 dosing, all patients were to receive low-dose corticosteroids and a histamine receptor-1 antagonist (e.g., 4 mg of dexamethasone orally and 50 mg of diphenhydramine IV). On Day 2 of each cycle, all patients were pre-medicated with the local clinic's regimen of corticosteroids and antihistamines prior to carboplatin and paclitaxel therapy.
