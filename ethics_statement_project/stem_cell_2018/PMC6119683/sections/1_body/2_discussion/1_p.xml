<p id="Par12">While evidence suggests that SSRIs have the ability to increase rates of osteoporotic fracture and dental implant failure rates, the direct effect of sertraline treatment on bone healing has yet to be elucidated. This study showed that sertraline exposure decreased bone healing with significant declines in Tb.Th and Tb.N, independent of specific circulating serum sertraline levels, suggesting a possible on/off mechanism of action for sertraline's effect on bone healing instead of a dose-dependent effect. While increased Tb.Sp coupled with significantly decreased Tb.N and Tb.Th after sertraline exposure support the decreased percent healing and bone volume observed in the sertraline-exposed groups, these significant differences did not lead to a corresponding significant decline in either factor. This disparity seems to indicate that, while the overall bone volume was not significantly affected by sertraline, the organization of the regenerated bone was severely hampered, with sertraline exposure causing the regenerating bone to be organized in thin, widely spaced trabeculae. Subsequently, histological analysis of the regenerate within the defect site showed increased amounts of disjoined woven bone with a lack of continuous bone regrowth after sertraline exposure. Bone organized in such a fashion would be unlikely to support a load, increasing the mobility within the defect site and therefore requiring an alternative healing pathway to accommodate such displacement.</p>
