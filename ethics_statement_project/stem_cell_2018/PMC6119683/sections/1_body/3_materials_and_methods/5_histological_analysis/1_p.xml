<p id="Par24">After µCT scanning, representative samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) from each group (sham, scaffold and BMP2 for control and sertraline-treated animals) were placed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 2 days, stored in 70% ethanol and then decalcified in 0.25 mol·L
 <sup>−1</sup> EDTA at pH 7.4 for 10 days. Samples were then washed, dehydrated in graded ethanol (70%–100%), cleared in xylene and embedded in paraffin. Histology and immunohistochemistry were performed on three 7-µm sections at least 30 μm apart per sample for analysis of the defect area. Sections were stained with Alcian Blue, Masson's Trichrome (MTC; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA USA), Picrosirius Red (PSR), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP; Sigma) by standard methods. Stained sections were photographed using a Motic Inverted Microscope with attached camera (Motic, BC, Canada), and the total area of each stain within the defect site was quantified using Visiopharm software (Visiopharm, Broomfield, CO). Alcian Blue sections were analysed for total area of cartilage (blue); MTC osteoid (red) and collagen tissue (blue); PSR for thin, immature (green), mid-range (yellow), and thick, mature (red) collagen fibres; and TRAP for TRAP-positive osteoclasts (red) within the defect site. MTC and PSR sections were analysed using a region of interest (ROI) isolating the endocranial side of the defect continuous with the surgical margin to better capture the regenerate while excluding the DermaMatrix scaffold.
