 </sup>, as well as isotype cell line myofibroblast C2C12 (ATCC, USA) and pre-osteoblasts MC3T3-E1 (E1; ATCC, USA) were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. E1 cells were cultured in Alpha Modified Eagle's Medium (αMEM; Lonza, USA), while the remaining cells were cultured in DMEM (Lonza, USA) containing 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlanta Biologics, USA), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (penstrep; Lonza, USA), and 0.2% amphotericin B (Lonza, USA) with media changes twice weekly until 95% confluence was reached. At confluence, cells were seeded at a density of 4 000 cells per well for cell function assays. Cells were treated for 3 or 7 days with control (culture) media or with media containing low-level sertraline (34.2 ng·mL
 <sup>-1</sup>) or high-level sertraline (342 ng·mL
 <sup>-1</sup>), correlating to human steady-state levels

 </sup>. Cell viability (proliferation) was assessed with the MTS assay (Promega, USA), and cell apoptosis was assessed with the Caspase 3/7 assay (Promega, USA). Quantitative ALP activity was assessed by lysing cells in a 0.1% Triton X lysis buffer, and the whole cell lysis was measured using a SigmaFast p-Nitrophenyl phosphate kit (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) by adding para-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) as a substrate assay buffer containing MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> for 30 min and reading the kinetics of absorbance at 405 nm on a Gen5 plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).
