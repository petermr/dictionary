<p id="Par8">Histological analysis of the defect site 4 weeks post-operatively showed more cartilage in the scaffold and BMP2 surgical groups for both the control and sertraline-exposed animals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">3</xref>). However, sertraline appeared to attenuate the ability of BMP2-treated animals to form cartilage. Masson's Trichrome analysis of the regenerates showed that sertraline-exposed animals contained significantly more collagen fibers (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.022), with both the scaffold (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.028) and BMP2 surgical groups (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.017) having more collagen within the regenerate than in the sham group for both groups. Consequently, the sertraline-exposed animals contained a significantly decreased amount of osteoid (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.010), while the scaffold and BMP2 surgical groups had increased osteoid formation within the regenerate compared with the sham group (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.003; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c–e</xref> and Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">4</xref>). To further characterize the collagen fibers within the defect, polarized Picrosirius red images were analysed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Quantification of the immature, thin (green; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>), medium thickness (yellow; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>) and mature, thick (red; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>) collagen fibers within the regenerate indicated that sertraline-exposed animals had increased yellow and red collagen fibers (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001, respectively) compared to the unexposed animals. Sham groups were excluded from analysis due to a lack of detectable polarized fibers for either the control or sertraline-exposed groups.
