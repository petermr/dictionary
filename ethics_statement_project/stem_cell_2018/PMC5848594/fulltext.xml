Loss of endothelial barrier integrity, inflammation, and impaired cellular oxygen have been shown to be primary contributors to sepsis. To date, little is known regarding the pathway for the mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from the bone marrow in sepsis whereas stromal-cell-derived factor 1a (SDF-1a) and hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) seem to have a role in the EPC response to hypoxic microenvironments.</p><p id="Par2">The aims of the study are: (a) to determine the time course of the levels of circulating EPCs (CD133/CD34), SDF-1a, and HIF-1 in septic patients undergoing major abdominal surgery (group S), (b) to investigate the relationship between CD133/CD34, HIF-1, and SDF-1a, and (c) to investigate the relationship of these factors with the outcome of group S patients treated with standard conventional therapy alone (CT) or with the addition of extracorporeal hemoperfusion therapy (HCT).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par3">Patients undergoing major abdominal surgery will be allocated into groups: postoperative non-septic patients in an emergency surgical ward (group C) and postoperative septic patients in an intensive care unit (group S).

Sepsis caused by intra-abdominal infection is associated with higher mortality ranging on average 30% to 60% because of (a) the broad spectrum of infection and disease severity, (b) the crucial role of surgery in the management of intra-abdominal infection, and (c) the ongoing emergence of multidrug resistance in pathogenic organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Evidence supports that the pathophysiology of sepsis moves from an initiating early/acute hyperinflammatory phase to a late/chronic hypoinflammatory and immunosuppressive phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. More recently, loss of endothelial barrier integrity, inflammation, and impaired cellular oxygen have been shown to be primary contributors to sepsis-related organ dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), a specific subtype of hematopoietic stem cell, are mobilized into the peripheral circulation under various pathologic conditions that are associated with vascular injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Mutunga et al. observed an increase of circulating endothelial cells during sepsis and concluded that endothelial damage occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, the quantification of EPCs in septic patients has had controversial results and Cribbs et al. demonstrated that the increased levels of EPCs were inversely associated with organ dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To date, little is known regarding the relationship between EPC and organ dysfunction in septic postoperative abdominal surgical patients.</p><p id="Par18">In addition, the pathway for the mobilization of EPCs from the bone marrow (BM) in sepsis or septic shock is still unknown. Emerging evidence suggests that stromal-cell-derived factor 1a (SDF-1a) mediates the migration of hematopoietic stem cells from BM to peripheral blood (PB), while hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), which regulates SDF-1a expression, is the central mediator of the cellular response to hypoxic microenvironments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims of the study</title><p id="Par19">Primary objective: To determine the time course of the levels of circulating EPCs (CD133/CD34), SDF-1a, and HIF-1 in septic patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.</p><p id="Par20">Secondary objective 1: To investigate the relationship between CD133/CD34, HIF-1, and SDF-1a.</p><p id="Par21">Secondary objective 2: To investigate the relationship between CD133/CD34, HIF-1, SDF-1a, and the outcome of sepsis and septic shock patients treated with standard conventional therapy alone (CT) or with the addition of extracorporeal hemoperfusion therapy (HCT).</p><p id="Par22">In this trial, we hypothesize that levels of CD133/CD34, HIF-1, and SDF-1a will increase in septic surgical patients as a consequence of impaired tissue perfusion and cellular hypoxia. Our hypothesis is that the stimulation of hypoxia-related factors, like SDF-1a and HIF-1, could be the primary step in the stimulation of BM stem cells. Furthermore, we assume that surviving septic patients will show higher levels of EPCs, HIF-1, and SDF-1a.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Recruitment</title><p id="Par23">This prospective observational clinical trial is designed to target postoperative patients undergoing major abdominal surgery and healthy volunteers at University Hospital Foggia.
