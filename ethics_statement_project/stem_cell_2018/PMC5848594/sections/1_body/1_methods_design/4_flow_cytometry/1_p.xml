<p id="Par37">The samples of whole blood (100 μl) will be stained within 1 h from taking the blood sample. To analyze the viability of the cells, they will be stained with 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD), which will bind to the DNA of cells that are undergoing or have undergone apoptosis (Stem Kit™ Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). The cell surface staining will be performed by adding the following fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibody reagents: fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD34 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) and phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CD133 (Miltenyi Biotech, USA). Staining will be performed according to the manufacturer's guidelines.</p>
