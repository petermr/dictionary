<p id="Par38">Cells will be fixed and permeabilized using the BD Intrasure kit (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and intracellular staining of HIF-1 will be performed using HIF-1 alpha (Alexa Fluor® 647 anti-human HIF-1α Antibody, BioLegend Inc., CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The samples will be resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed with a FACS Caliber flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and FCS3 software. Cell will be acquired with a four-parameter flow cytometry method (CD34 FITC/CD133 PE/CD45 PerCP/ HIF-1 ACP staining, side, and forward angle light scatter). The flow cytometer will be calibrated every 24 h and quality controls performed according to the UK National External Quality Assessment Service protocol. The number of CD34/CD133/HIF-1 cells in PB will be calculated as the count of absolute lymphocytes times the percentage (%) of gated CD34/CD133 positive cells, and expressed as absolute number of cells per 1 μl PB.</p>
