<p id="Par50">T cell reactivity by IFNγ ELISpot analysis after in vitro stimulation was assessed against the AML-related antigens WT-1 and PRAME, both of which were expressed by the DCP-001, as well as against NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-A3. NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-A3 are not expressed by DCP-001 but were included to monitor for possible epitope spreading, i.e., T cell responses primed against epitopes released from the patients' autologous blasts after a successful DCP-001 induced anti-AML immune response. Indeed, instances of induced de novo or boosted pre-existent responses were found post-vaccination for all four TAAs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, b). Overall, four out of eight evaluable patients showed DCP-001 induced or enhanced WT-1, PRAME, MAGE-A3, or NY-ESO-1 responses (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). An unexpectedly high number of patients (3 out of 3) showed enhanced post-vaccination responses against NY-ESO-1, of which one was de novo primed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). For one patient (004), also pre-and post-treatment bone marrow samples were available revealing upregulated NY-ESO-1 T cell reactivity at day 126 (Supplementary Fig. 1). All tested patients showed pre-existent reactivity to the CEFT recall antigen pool, which was maintained over treatment, indicating good immune competence (data not shown). An overview of pre- and post-vaccination ELISpot responses of all four patients with post-vaccination-positive ELISpot reactivities (expressed as specific T cell numbers per 10
 <sup>5</sup> T cells) are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2.
