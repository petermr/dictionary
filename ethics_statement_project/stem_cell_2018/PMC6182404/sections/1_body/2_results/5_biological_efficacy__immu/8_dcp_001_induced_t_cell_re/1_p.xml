<p id="Par59">Overall, the immune-monitoring data clearly demonstrate DCP-001-induced T cell reactivity. When results from all T cell-related assays were combined, an "Overall T cell Score” was derived (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). To arrive at the T cell score, vaccination-induced T cell immune responses were scored in four different categories, i.e., (1) T cell proliferative response to the DCP-001, (2) a positive post-vaccination leukemia-associated antigen-specific ELISpot reactivity, (3) increased number of infiltrating CD4
 <sup>+</sup> or CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the superficial dermis of the post-vaccination DTH site (by immunohistochemistry, see Supplementary Fig. 3b and 4) post-vaccination increase in DTH site induration. Positive responses in each of the categories (as defined in the "
 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>”) resulted in a point per category, with a low score of 0 out of 4 and a possible highest T cell score of 4 out of 4. These analyses demonstrated significantly lower scores (5 positive assays out of 15 conducted) in short-term survivors (≤ 6 months) versus long-term survivors.
