<p id="Par40">The safety, feasibility, and biological effects of DCP-001 vaccination were investigated in 12 elderly AML patients in a 3 + 3 dose design. Final assessment was done after 126 days, i.e., 3 months after the last (4th) vaccination. Patient characteristics are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Blast percentages as listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> were based on standard cytomorphology. For listing of prior therapies and cytogenetic features of the patient's tumors, we refer to Supplementary Table 1. Patients (age range 58–71), enrolled were either in CR1/CR2 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) or had smoldering disease (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7). Twelve patients initiated vaccination of which ten patients received all four vaccinations (83,3%) and two patients (002 and 011) received three vaccinations. One patient discontinued due to disease progression (002) and one patient (011) due to a candida endocarditis.
