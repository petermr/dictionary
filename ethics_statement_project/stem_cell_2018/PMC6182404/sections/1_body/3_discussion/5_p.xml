<p id="Par64">DCP-001-induced immune responses were observed in patients from all cohorts and not restricted to the higher dose levels. Overall T cell reactivity (expressed as ‘T cell score’, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) was significantly higher in long-term survivors (&gt; 6 months). Though more patients would be needed for conclusive evidence, this is suggestive of a causal relationship between DCP-001-induced antitumor immunity and clinical outcome. Of note, patients with a maintained low blast count were more likely to develop an immune response to the vaccine, advocating the testing of such immunotherapies in patients with less advanced stages of disease.
