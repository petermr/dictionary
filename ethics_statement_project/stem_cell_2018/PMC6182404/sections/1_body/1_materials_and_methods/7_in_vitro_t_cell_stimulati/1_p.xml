<p id="Par36">DCP-001 induced T cell responses to full-length TAAs WT-1, PRAME, MAGE-A3 or NY-ESO-1 were measured by IFNγ ELISpot assay as previously described [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In brief, overlapping 15-mer peptide pools (JPT peptide technologies, Berlin, Germany) were loaded onto autologous irradiated PBMC which were co-cultured with an equal number of non-irradiated PBMC for 10 days. At day 10, the cells were seeded in an ELISpot plate in the presence of the corresponding peptide pools for 24 h after which an ELISpot read-out was performed. A 15-mer CEFT peptide pool served as a positive recall antigen response control. PHA was used for technical and sample quality control. The ELISpot assay was performed using an anti-IFNγ mAb pair (Mabtech, Nacka, Sweden [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]). T cell activity was expressed as the number of spots per 100,000 T cells (determined by CD3 FACS analysis at the time of ELISpot read-out) and considered positive when, (1) the number of spots in the TAA test condition was significantly higher than the number of spots in the HIV control condition (unpaired Student's 
 <italic>t</italic> test), (2) the mean number of spots of the test condition exceeded the number of spots of the control condition by at least twofold and (3) the absolute difference in number of spots between the test and control condition was at least five.
