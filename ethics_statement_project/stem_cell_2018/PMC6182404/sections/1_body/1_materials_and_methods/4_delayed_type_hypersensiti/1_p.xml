<p id="Par32">DTH testing was performed to monitor patient's cell-mediated immunity before and after treatment by i.d. injection of DCP-001 (2 million cells/0.2 mL) or vehicle control (CS10), at start of vaccination and 7 days after the fourth vaccination. Induration was measured in mm across two diameters after 48 h. Results were expressed as the mean induration. Positive DTH reactions were defined as &gt; 5 mm diameter induration. A difference between first (Pre-Vacc) and second (Post-Vacc) skin test reactions exceeding 50% of the Pre-Vacc measurement, with a Post-Vacc reactivity &gt; 5 mm, was considered to reflect positive vaccination reactivity.</p>
