 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] at day 0, day 49 (1 week after fourth vaccination) and day 126 (12 weeks after fourth vaccination). Serum was collected at similar time points and stored at − 80 °C. Monocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were isolated from PBMC by CD14 magnetic bead isolation (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) following manufacturers’ instructions. PBMC, PBL and monocytes were cryopreserved in C.T.L. CryoABC cryopreservation medium (ImmunoSpot, Cleveland, USA).
