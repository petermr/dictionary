<p id="Par86">Adverse events are defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a trial participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. Adverse events will be collected via self-report during the 2- and 12-month data collection, and by the study nurse following each injection. This will include questions about any adverse events that participants believe may be related to the study intervention, including their nature, how long they lasted for and what action if any, they took (e.g. taking medication or seeing a health professional). Serious adverse events are defined as any untoward and unexpected medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing inpatient's hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or any other important medical condition which may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed [
