    <italic>Average overall knee pain severity</italic>: this will be measured at baseline, 2, 6, 9 and 12 months using an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) with terminal descriptors 'no pain' (score 0) and 'worst pain possible' (score 10). This was chosen because it has well-established clinimetric properties in knee OA and established minimal clinically important differences [

   <p id="Par64">
    <italic>Medial tibial cartilage volume</italic>: an MRI scan of the study knee will be performed at baseline and 12 months using a 3 T whole body system with a dedicated extremity coil and a T1-weighted fat-suppressed 3D gradient recall acquisition sequence (Additional file 
    <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Medial tibial cartilage volume will be measured by manually drawing disarticulation contours around the cartilage edges, section by section. To reduce measurement error and bias, one person will measure each participant's paired set of images, blinded to time sequence and treatment allocation. Regular quality review will occur in 20% of images by a second reader. Our coefficients of variation for these measures are 2.3–2.4% [
