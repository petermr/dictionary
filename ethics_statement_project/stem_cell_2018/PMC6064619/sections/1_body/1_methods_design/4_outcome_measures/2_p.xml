    <italic>Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain (ICOAP) questionnaire:</italic> measured at baseline, 2 months and 12 months. This is a self-report multi-dimensional, OA-specific measure of pain experience, with established reliability, internal consistency and validity in people with knee OA [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It is comprised of 5-items assessing constant knee pain in the previous week, and 6-items assessing intermittent knee pain in the previous week. Questions regarding pain intensity have terminal responses of 'not at all' (score 0) and 'extremely' (score 4), and questions regarding pain frequency have 'never' (score 0) to 'very often' (score 4). Total scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating worse pain.
