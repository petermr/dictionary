<p id="Par56">Participants will be randomly allocated by telephone to the PRP injection group or the placebo injection group using a randomisation schedule prepared and stored by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Clinical Trial Centre. Randomisation will occur according to a 1:1 allocation ratio in blocks with varying sizes of 6 or 10, stratified according to site (Melbourne or Sydney) and radiographic disease severity (Kellgren and Lawrence grades 2 or 3). At the first treatment appointment, a study nurse will telephone the NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre just before administration of the first injection to reveal the participant's group allocation.</p>
