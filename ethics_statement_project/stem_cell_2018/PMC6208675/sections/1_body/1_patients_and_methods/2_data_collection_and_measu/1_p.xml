<p id="Par8">In the Connect MM registry, PRO measures were administered to assess overall HRQoL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–General; FACT-G), myeloma-specific concerns (FACT-Multiple Myeloma subscale; FACT-MM), pain severity (Brief Pain Inventory; BPI), and health utilities (EuroQol Research Foundation EQ-5D questionnaire) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. PROs were completed in the clinic at study enrollment (study baseline) and approximately quarterly (based on frequency of clinic visits) thereafter until the end of the study’s follow-up period, early study discontinuation, or death. In efforts to minimize the variability of HRQoL scores among patients who are treated at their physicians’ discretion (proving more difficult to collect HRQoL assessments closer to the initiation of maintenance therapy), HRQoL assessments analyzed were those collected at study baseline, after induction therapy but prior to ASCT (analytical baseline or t0), and quarterly from 100 days post-ASCT until the end of maintenance therapy or until progressive disease, discontinuation, or death (analytic period).
