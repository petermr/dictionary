In order to minimize bias and better understand the representativeness of the Registry population, consecutive MM patients presenting to the sites were evaluated for potential enrollment, though participation in the registry was voluntary. All medical treatment (including medications, follow-up, and post-treatment laboratory testing) was administered at the treating physician’s discretion as per standard of care. Patients aged ≥18 years who had symptomatic NDMM within 2 months before study entry and signed informed consent were eligible for inclusion in the registry. MM diagnosis was asked to be defined per International Myeloma Working Group criteria [
