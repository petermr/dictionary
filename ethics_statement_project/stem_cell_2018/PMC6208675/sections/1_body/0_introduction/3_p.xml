<p id="Par4">Findings from several randomized controlled trials with continuous lenalidomide therapy have shown significant improvements in PFS [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and overall survival (OS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], with moderate and manageable adverse event (AE) profiles. A recent meta-analysis of lenalidomide maintenance therapy post-ASCT data from three of these studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which were not individually powered to assess OS, reported an OS benefit associated with lenalidomide maintenance therapy compared with control (no maintenance therapy) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Lenalidomide maintenance therapy has been approved by the FDA and EMA and is recommended for use after ASCT in several guidelines for MM treatment. However, important questions remain, including the optimal length of maintenance treatment, patient subsets that will benefit most/least from maintenance, and the role of combination therapies for maintenance. Components of maintenance tend to emphasize survival benefit and manageable toxicities; opponents argue that the risks of long-term toxic effects outweigh the clinical benefits and advocate for the inclusion of a treatment-free interval to preserve patients’ health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Because the prolonged treatment duration of maintenance therapies requires tolerability and minimal impact on HRQoL, excessive toxicity from otherwise promising agents has previously limited the applicability of these agents in this setting [
