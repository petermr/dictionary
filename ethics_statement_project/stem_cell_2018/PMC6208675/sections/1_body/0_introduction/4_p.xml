<p id="Par5">Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) contribute an additional valuable perspective in the ongoing maintenance discussion by quantifying the effects of long-term therapy on HRQoL directly from patients. Few HRQoL analyses of patients undergoing post-ASCT maintenance therapy have been published [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and none report real-world outcomes in community settings. The Connect MM Registry enrolled more than 3000 patients with NDMM, the vast majority (&gt; 80%) from community settings. This registry was established as a research initiative to better understand the natural history and management of MM across community, academic, and government treatment centers. In addition to describing practice patterns, a secondary objective for the registry is to characterize the HRQoL of patients and to explore its association with treatment regimens/sequence and clinical outcomes. Data from the Connect MM registry have been used previously to establish baseline demographic and disease characteristics and to analyze the incidence of second primary malignancies among patients treated with lenalidomide [

 <italic>n</italic> = 1493), which includes patients with NDMM who received ASCT and did or did not receive maintenance therapy during the follow-up period, to provide insights on the effects of maintenance therapy on HRQoL based on patients' experiences.
