<p id="Par11">It is now well-established that momelotinib treatment in MF provides relief from symptomatic splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms, and unlike most other JAK2 inhibitors, also improves anemia in a substantial fraction of patients

 </sup>. Side effects of MMB, including thrombocytopenia and increased serum levels of liver and pancreas enzymes, can be monitored closely and might require drug dose adjustments. On the other hand, drug-induced peripheral neuropathy, which occurs in more than a third of the patients, might require earlier treatment discontinuation because of the possibility of irreversible damage

 </sup>. Our long-term experience suggests that MMB is otherwise well tolerated and capable of inducing durable benefit, in a subset of molecularly appropriate patients, and without the unwanted side effect of drug-induced anemia.
