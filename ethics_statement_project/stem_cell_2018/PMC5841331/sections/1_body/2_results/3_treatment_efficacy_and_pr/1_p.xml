<p id="Par7">Clinical improvement (CI) was achieved by 57 (57%) patients and included anemia response in 44%, and spleen response in 43% of informative cases. Response in both anemia and spleen was recorded in 12 patients while 27 and 18 patients experienced "spleen only” or "anemia only” response. Fifty-one percent of transfusion-dependent patients became transfusion independent. The majority of patients also had marked improvement in their symptoms. Forty-nine (86%) of the 57 patients with CI have since discontinued treatment, after a median treatment duration of 2.3 years. CI was more likely to occur in 
 <italic>ASXL1</italic>-unmutated (66%) vs mutated (44%) cases (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.03) and in patients with circulating blast count &lt;2% (66% vs 42%; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02); CI was not influenced by driver mutational status (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.34), DIPSS-plus risk (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.97), 
 <italic>SRSF2</italic> mutations (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.51), abnormal (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.84), or unfavorable (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.36) karyotype, prior JAK2 inhibitor therapy (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.63), leukocyte count (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.17), platelet count (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.5), or spleen size (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.1). Durability of response was assessed by relapse-free survival, which was adversely affected by absence of type 1/like 
 <italic>CALR</italic> (HR 2.9; 95% CI 1.1–7.3) or presence of very high-risk karyotype (HR 3.5; 95% CI 1.2–10.7).
