<p>One-hundred and seven patients went off therapy during consolidation or interim maintenance-1, with the reason stated being “physician determines it is in the best interest of the patient” (n=86; 32 in the control arm and 54 in experimental arm 1) or “refusal of further protocol therapy by patient/parent/guardian” (n=21; 3 in the control arm and 18 in experimental arm 1): Some of these patients may have proceeded to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Long-term study outcomes may be published in the future when follow-up data are more mature.</p>
