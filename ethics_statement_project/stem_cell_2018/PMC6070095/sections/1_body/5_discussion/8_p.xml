<p>Because prolonged B-cell aplasia is a known complication after targeted CD19 therapy, we looked for infections consistent with a humoral immune deficiency (eg, recurrent sinopulmonary infections, diarrhea) and evaluated hypogammaglobulinemia in our survival model. However, in the patients for whom IgG levels were available, hypogammaglobulinemia was mild, obviating the need for routine immunoglobulin replacement. Although we did not see clear examples of humoral immune deficiency, the number of examined patients (n = 24) was small, and the rate, degree, and duration of B-cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia may vary, depending on the patients’ age (children vs adults) and the duration of CAR T-cell persistence and therefore may require further prospective evaluations.</p>
