<p id="Par31">It is standard practice in current genetic association studies to include an independent replication cohort to validate findings from the initial discovery cohort. However, few large cohorts exist that have sufficient numbers of female CCS, let alone with complete data as well as stored DNA and AMH for analysis. For this project, a collaboration with the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis USA and CCSS has been initiated. AMH levels will be measured in the same laboratory with the same AMH assay for the discovery and replication cohort, thus minimizing lab variation. Given the (non-significant) GWAS observations in the St Jude discovery cohort we believe forces must be joined, and we are therefore actively looking for additional cohorts to include in this and future international collaborations. We encourage readers who are aware of such collections to contact the corresponding author.</p>
