<p>Host immune response will always be a matter for concern whenever an allograft is involved

 </sup>. To accurately evaluate immunogenicity of an allograft would require testing for HLA compatibility. The fact that the NPC cell line used in this trial consistently expressed low levels of MHC-I (&lt;10%) gave us reason to believe that HLA matching was unwarranted for graft survival. Nonetheless, given the fact that the blood–brain barrier was disrupted by cell grafting, thereby altering the central nervous system’s status of immune privilege

 </sup>, and could potentially result in the host’s immune system to become sensitized to NPCs, all patients were immunosuppressed for 1 month. The safety of the intervention and the lack of tumors and immune response observed after NPC grafting are encouraging reasons to further develop our strategy to treat PD with NPCs.
