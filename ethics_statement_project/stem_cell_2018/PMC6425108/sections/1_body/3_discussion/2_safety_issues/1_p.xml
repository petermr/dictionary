<p>Host immune response will always be a matter for concern whenever an allograft is involved

 </sup>. To accurately evaluate immunogenicity of an allograft would require testing for HLA compatibility. The fact that the NPC cell line used in this trial consistently expressed low levels of MHC-I (&lt;10%) gave us reason to believe that HLA matching was unwarranted for graft survival. Nonetheless, given the fact that the bloodâ€“brain barrier was disrupted by cell grafting, thereby altering the central nervous system's status of immune privilege

 </sup>, and could potentially result in the host's immune system to become sensitized to NPCs, all patients were immunosuppressed for 1 month. The safety of the intervention and the lack of tumors and immune response observed after NPC grafting are encouraging reasons to further develop our strategy to treat PD with NPCs.
