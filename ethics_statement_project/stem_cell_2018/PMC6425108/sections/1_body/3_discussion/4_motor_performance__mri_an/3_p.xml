<p>Improved motor function of patients in the RAC/DTBZ group (P1, P3, P5, and P6) seen at both their 1- and 2-year evaluations was correlated with their putaminal PET scans, which suggests enhanced dopaminergic activity. Patients’ motor improvement on the UPDRS-III might be attributed to enhanced activity of their still functional putaminal D2 receptors, in response to the apparently increased availability of endogenous dopamine, as inferred from decreased RAC binding

 </sup>. Dopamine might have been released from pre-synaptic terminals of newly differentiated dopaminergic neurons derived from the graft, as the moderately enhanced uptake of DTBZ might suggest. Putaminal FDOPA/DTBZ scans for P2, P5, and P7, however, did not correlate well with patients’ motor improvements, especially at their 2-year follow-up. It has to be pointed out that the enhanced dopaminergic activity alone may not result in clinical motor improvement, as evidenced by a finding that robust graft survival and normalized dopaminergic innervation did not result in recovery in a PD patient
