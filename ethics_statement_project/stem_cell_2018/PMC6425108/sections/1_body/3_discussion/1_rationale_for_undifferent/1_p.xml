<p>This project was designed to test the safety of stereotactic bilateral grafting to the putamina of PD patients of a highly controlled, standardized, culture-manufactured, undifferentiated NPC cell line. The secondary goals were to explore the potential of this approach to reduce PD motor symptoms, as assessed on the UPDRS, and to evaluate the effects on dopaminergic neurotransmission within the diseased striatal tissue, as inferred from PET functional images of biomarkers for dopaminergic neuronal activity. Although beyond the scope of this study, our intention further on was to assess this cell line's capability to improve not only dopaminergic neurotransmission but also non-dopaminergic neuronal pathways in the diseased PD brain.</p>
