 </sup>. Stereotactic injection of stem cells produced statistically significant improvement in behavioral scores and weight of the animals. Life span of the injected animals doubled. Histological and immunohistochemical examination showed incorporation of the stem cells into hosts' brains as human mature Calbindin-positive neurons and glial cells. Successful injection of NPCs into a genetic model of cerebellar ataxia allows us to hypothesize that these undifferentiated cells have capabilities to correct pathology caused by gene mutations.
