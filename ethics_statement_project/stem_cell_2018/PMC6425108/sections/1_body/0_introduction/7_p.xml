<p>Here we have performed a surgical procedure to treat PD involving bilateral intraputaminal grafting of undifferentiated NPCs in a case series study. Our initial aim has been to explore the safety of the procedure and to identify possible neurological (motor function) and neuropsychological (non-motor symptoms) benefits the procedure might have induced. Patients’ response to grafting was assessed at 1, 2, and 4 years post-surgery using current functional standard neurological and neuropsychological tests, as well as advanced functional positron emission tomography (PET) imaging protocols with the following radiopharmaceuticals to initially assess only the dopaminergic neuronal pathway activity or integrity: [
 <sup>11</sup>C]raclopride (RAC) for endogenous dopamine availability; 6-[
 <sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA) for dopaminergic nerve terminal metabolic activity, and alpha-[
 <sup>11</sup>C] dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ) for nigrostriatal terminal integrity (PET examination was not performed at 4 years due to radiation dose safety concerns).
