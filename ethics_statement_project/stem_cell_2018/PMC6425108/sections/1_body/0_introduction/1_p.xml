<p>Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, degenerative neurological disorder of the basal ganglia of unknown origin that affects pigmented dopamine-producing nerve cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) which regulate the excitability of striatal neurons, primarily those in the dorsolateral putamen

 </sup>. When PD depletes pre-synaptic dopamine from nerve terminals in the nigrostriatal tract by ∼80% (that is ∼ 60% loss of dopaminergic neurons of the SNpc)

 </sup>, post-synaptic dopaminergic receptors in the putamen and head of the caudate nucleus are not adequately stimulated. Consequently, uninhibited striatal neurons fire excessively and alter normal functioning of basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits, leading to motor symptoms such as resting tremor, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia, impaired gait and postural instability, speech, and mask-like facial expression

 </sup>. Loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons that send axons to the basal ganglia has also been related to non-motor symptoms present in Parkinson's patients, such as dementia and cognitive impairment, depression, and anxiety

 </sup>. Moreover, non-motor symptoms refractory to available treatments for dopamine deficiency in PD might also be attributed to non-dopaminergic neurotransmitter deficiencies within or outside the basal ganglia that are known to occur in PD such as striatum serotonin, acetylcholine, gamma aminobutyric acid, and noradrenaline, which would imply the requirement of non-dopaminergic drugs besides dopamine to treat PD
