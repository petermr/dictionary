<p>Right and left caudate nuclei PET imaging scores for RAC, FDOPA, and DTBZ uptake are shown in

 <xref rid="table7-0963689718820271" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> Comparing caudate nuclei RAC scores for patients P1, P3, P5, and P6 with their corresponding bilateral putaminal scores given in 
 <xref rid="table6-0963689718820271" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, it can be seen that at baseline, RAC uptake in the caudate nuclei was less than that seen in the putamina by an approximate factor of 1.6, and that their scores at 1 and 2 years post-surgery reveal, on average, greater decreases in RAC uptake than in the putamina. In the caudate nuclei, percent average improvement compared with baseline was of 52%, 66%, 29%, and 20% in the first year post-surgery, and of 72%, 46%, 28%, and 55% for the second year for patients P1, P3, P5, and P6, respectively. FDOPA levels in the caudate nuclei were similar to those found in the putamina. Compared with baseline, patients P2 and P4 percent average FDOPA uptake went from a loss of 21% and 1% in the first year post-surgery, to a greater loss of 34% and 10% at their second year post-surgery follow-up. P7 showed a percent average increase in FDOPA uptake of 20% in the first year post-surgery that was down by 65% at the patient's 2-year follow-up. DTBZ uptake values in the caudate nuclei decreased in a range between 17% and 67% the first year post-surgery (excepting P5, who gained 41%), and 12% and 71% the second year post-surgery (excepting P1, who gained 131%).
