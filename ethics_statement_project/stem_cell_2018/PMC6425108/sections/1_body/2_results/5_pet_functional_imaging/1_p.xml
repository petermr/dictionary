 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963689718820271">Fig. 3</xref>. All right and left putamina PET imaging scores for RAC, FDOPA, and DTBZ uptake at baseline, and 1 and 2 years post-surgery are shown in 
 <xref rid="table6-0963689718820271" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, and the percent average change differences among them are given in 
 <xref rid="table7-0963689718820271" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>. Compared with baseline, RAC uptake decreased in all four cases tested at patients’ 1-year evaluation; the percent average changes for each patient (P1, P3, P5, P6) were 36%, 45%, 19%, and 21%, respectively. Two years after surgery, RAC average uptake in putamina increased in all cases except one (P6), but remained lower than at baseline by 31%, 18%, and 7% for patients P1, P3, and P5, respectively. The percent average decrease of RAC uptake for P6 was 39%. At their 1-year evaluations, percent average bilateral putaminal FDOPA uptake scores, compared with baseline, showed a gain of 5% and 7% for patients P4 and P7, respectively, but a 12% loss for patient P2. At their 2-year post-surgery evaluations, all patients showed percent average losses of FDOPA uptake, compared with baseline, of 29%, 5%, and 13% for patients P2, P4, and P7, respectively. Percent average bilateral putaminal DTBZ uptake, compared with baseline, 1 year post-surgery showed gains of 15% and 50% for patients P3 and P5, respectively, and losses of 5–27% for patients P2, P4, and P6; at their 2-year evaluations, gains went from 9–17% for patients P2, P3, P5, and P7, and losses from 10–22% for patients P1, P4, and P6.
