At the end of several needle tracks at 1, 2, and 4-year follow-ups small clusters of hypointensity on T2-weighted images were identified. At the annual MRI monitoring of P4, a robust graft outgrowth was observed in the right putamen (

 <sup>18</sup>F]-fluorothymidine (
 <sup>18</sup>F-FLT) were performed and showed no evidence of tumor formation. Quantitative volumetric analysis was not performed at this time.
