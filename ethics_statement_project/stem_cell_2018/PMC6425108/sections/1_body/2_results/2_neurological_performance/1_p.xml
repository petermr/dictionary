In the first year post-surgery, patients' UPDRS II, III, and IV scores revealed improved neurological function in their OFF and ON conditions. Motor function examinations showed improvement (UPDRS III), and their motor-related daily living activities improved as well (UPDRS II). Non-motor daily living experiences related to mood and behavior, as rated on the UPDRS I (
 <xref rid="table2-0963689718820271" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), were unequally affected by surgery and showed minor variations or remained unchanged, with two exceptions that showed a poor response (P2 and P5). From patients' UPDRS II, III, and IV scores at their 2-year post-surgery evaluations, loss of neurological function was evident, although still remaining slightly better than their scores at baseline.
