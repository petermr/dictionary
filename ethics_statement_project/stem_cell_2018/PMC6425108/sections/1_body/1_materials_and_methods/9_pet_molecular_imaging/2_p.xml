<p>Before scanning, cannulas were placed in antecubital veins for radioligand injection. Sterile solutions containing on average of 370 MBq RAC, 185 MBq FDOPA, and 370 MBq DTBZ were injected intravenously as a bolus. To minimize patients' exposure to radiation, only two of the three radiopharmaceuticals were used per patient. All patients underwent DTBZ-PET scans and one additional study with either RAC (four patients) or FDOPA (three patients), at least 1 week apart. Patients for either marker were chosen at random. Two healthy male non-PD controls aged 69 and 70 years of age received similar doses of radiopharmaceuticals as PD patients. Here too, only two of the three radiomarkers were used per control individual.</p>
