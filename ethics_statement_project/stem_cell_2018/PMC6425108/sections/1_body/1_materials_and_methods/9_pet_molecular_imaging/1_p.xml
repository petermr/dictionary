 <italic>In vivo</italic> pre- and post-synaptic state of patients' nigrostriatal dopaminergic system was investigated by PET molecular imaging in their OFF condition (patients were asked to discontinue anti-parkinsonian medications at least 12 h before each study) at baseline (before surgery), and 1 and 2 years post-surgery. Radiopharmaceuticals were synthesized by us at the Unidad Radiofarmacia-Ciclotron, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de MÃ©xico (Mexico City, Mexico) and were: RAC, a post-synaptic dopamine D2-receptor antagonist

 </sup>, a measure of dopamine availability; FDOPA, a marker for dopamine storage capacity and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase activity, both of which are affected by the disease
