<p>This is a case series study (uncontrolled, longitudinal, and interventional), designed (authors I.M., O.K.) to test the safety and potential benefits of bilateral intraputaminal grafting (I.M., F.J., E.M., C.Z.) of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> expanded NPCs (O.K., A.K.) to control PD signs and symptoms. Eight patients with moderate PD were selected for this study. Individually they underwent baseline, 6 months, 1, 2, and 4 years post-surgery neurological (H.C.) and neuropsychological evaluations (F.O., G.G.), and PET imaging (baseline, 1 and 2 year post-operatively) (M.A.A.R., A.A.E.). Magnetic resonance (MR) images (R.C., neuroradiologist) were performed before surgery and 24 h, 6 months, and 1, 2, and 4 years post-surgery. Patients were tested for immune response to stem cells at baseline and 6 months post-surgery. The primary functional outcome of the intervention was patients' post-surgery neurological performance. Post-surgery neuropsychological performance, MR and PET imaging, and immune response were secondary outcome measures. Patients were monitored for any adverse effects. This was a single-center study (T.V., scientific coordinator). The manuscript was prepared by I.M., O.K., R.E.F.B., and G.G.
