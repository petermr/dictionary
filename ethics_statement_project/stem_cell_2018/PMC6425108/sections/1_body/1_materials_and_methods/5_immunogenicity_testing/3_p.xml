 </sup>. Patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (effector cells) were isolated and incubated with NPCs (target cells) at 100:1, 50:1, and 25:1 effector to target ratios, using the following staining scheme: live effector cells: no dye; dead effector cells: only 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) (BioLegend); live target cells: PKH-67 only (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and dead target cells: PKH-67 and -7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD)

 </sup>. Staining was performed according to dye manufacturer's instructions. This staining arrangement permitted discrimination of cell populations and quantification of NPCs lysed by PBMCs.
