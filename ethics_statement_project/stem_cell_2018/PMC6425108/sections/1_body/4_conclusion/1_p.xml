<p>The intervention appears to be safe. At 4 years post-transplantation we can now report that undifferentiated NPCs can be delivered by stereotaxis bilaterally to the putamina of patients with moderate to severe PD, without any complications attributable to the procedure. None of the patients showed unwanted motor disturbances (dyskinesias), tumor formation, or any detectable immune responses to the grafted cells. In six out of seven cases the procedure resulted in improved motor function, and a better response to L-DOPA (particularly in one remarkable case). Given that PD is a progressive disease, the 4-year data suggest that at the very least the NPCs are able to stop or slow down the motor deterioration one would expect to see in this timespan. Patients' PET functional scans suggest that their improvements might be at least in some cases attributable to enhanced putaminal dopaminergic neurotransmission. Patients' satisfactory pre-surgery neuropsychological scores were unaffected by grafting.</p>
