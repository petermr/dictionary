<p id="p0040">The surgical procedure was conducted under general anaesthesia. We performed 3-port pars plana vitrectomy, with separation of the posterior hyaloid from the posterior pole toward the equator. Administration of hESC-derived RPE cells was preceded by subretinal injection of up to 0.2 ml Hartmann's solution using a 41-gauge cannula to establish the target tissue plane and to minimize unintended administration of cells into the vitreous or choroid. The hESC-derived RPE cell suspension, reconstituted to the appropriate concentration in 150 Î¼l, was injected using a 38-gauge subretinal cannula (MedOne PolyTip Cannula 23/38; MedOne Surgical, Sarasota, FL) into the preformed bleb of Hartmann's solution. After subretinal injection, we performed a washout of the vitreous cavity by continuous infusion and aspiration of fluid to minimize the presence of donor cells remaining in this compartment. Participants were advised to maintain a supine position for 6 hours after surgery.</p>
