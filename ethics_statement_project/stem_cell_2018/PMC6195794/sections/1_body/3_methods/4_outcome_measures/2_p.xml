<p id="p0060">We evaluated participants at baseline and after hESC-derived RPE cell transplantation at intervals for 12 months. We performed examination by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and indirect binocular ophthalmoscopy, color fundus photography, FAF imaging, fundus fluorescein angiography, and SD OCT. We measured best-corrected VA (BCVA) and color discrimination (Universal Colour Discrimination Test) and performed microperimetry (Nidek MP-1, NIDEK Inc, Fremont, CA) full-field static perimetry (Octopus 900, Haag-Streit, Switzerland), Goldmann kinetic perimetry, and electroretinography (including full-field, pattern, and multifocal electroretinography to international standards using gold-foil electrodes). We used standardized protocols and a fixed sequence of test patterns. We assessed participants' systemic health by physical examination results, electrocardiography results, cancer screening results, and hematologic and serologic results. After completion of the initial 12-month evaluation period, participants were followed up for long-term safety assessments, the anticipated duration of which is lifelong.</p>
