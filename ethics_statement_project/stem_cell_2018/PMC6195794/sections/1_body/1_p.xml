 </xref> Degeneration of RPE cells leads to secondary dysfunction and degeneration of overlying photoreceptor cells, and consequently progressively severe impairment of sight. Stargardt disease currently is untreatable, but replenishment of degenerating RPE cells with healthy cells offers the possibility of benefit by better supporting the function and survival of overlying photoreceptor cells, and consequently improving or protecting sight for a period limited by the consequences of the underlying photoreceptor disorder. A similar approach may benefit atrophic age-related macular degeneration, which shares key features with STGD1, including progressive atrophy of RPE and overlying photoreceptor cells. However, differences in their cause and progression are likely to influence the potential benefit of subretinal administration of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived RPE cell suspensions. For example, age-related changes in Bruch's (basement) membrane and chronic inflammation in age-related macular degeneration may influence the adhesion and survival of donor cells.
