<p id="p0090">Areas of subretinal hyperpigmentation corresponded on SD OCT to a hyperreflective signal located between the photoreceptor cell layer and the underlying Bruch's membrane that persisted for 12 months in all eyes. Focal changes in FAF, which may be an indirect indication of RPE cell function, were evident within the region of cell administration. A relative predilection for the development of hyperpigmentation at sites of retinal atrophy within the injected area was evident. In 1 patient (patient 4), a circular region of atrophic retina, which on SD OCT appeared to be devoid of RPE, developed progressively confluent hyperpigmentation with increasing subretinal hyperreflectivity on SD OCT and masking of choroidal hyperreflectivity (

We investigated the relationship between hyperpigmentation and retinal thickness using SD OCT in the 3 participants (patients 8, 9, and 10) whose fixation stability enabled reliable serial analysis; in 2 participants (patients 8 and 9), we identified no clear relationship; in 1 participant (patient 10), who was administered the highest dose, retinal thinning was evident in the hyperpigmented areas at 12 months (
