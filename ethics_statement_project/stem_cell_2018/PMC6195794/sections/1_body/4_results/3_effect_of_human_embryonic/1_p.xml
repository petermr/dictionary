<p id="p0100">We measured no clinically significant decline or improvement in retinal function by electroretinography in any of the participants during the 12-month period. Participant-reported quality of life using the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire indicated no significant change. A transient reduction in BCVA of operated eyes was evident in 7 participants (patients 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, and 12) after surgery and resolved within 9±6 days (range, 3–21 days;

Borderline improvements in BCVA were evident in 4 participants, although these were either unsustained (patients 1, 7, and 10) or matched by a similar improvement in the contralateral eye (patient 12). The mean BCVA of the 150 000-cell dose improved to the limit of baseline variability; for the other dose groups, the mean BCVA remained within the limits of test–retest variability during the 12-month period. The participants’ preferred loci of fixation were unaltered (data not shown).
