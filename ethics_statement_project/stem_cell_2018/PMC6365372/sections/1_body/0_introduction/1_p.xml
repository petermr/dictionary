<p id="Par2">In patients whose B-cell or T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is refractory, or has relapsed after first-line therapy, high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) is considered the standard of care in eligible patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Historically, chemotherapy and/or cytokines have been used to mobilize peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for collection by apheresis, and the CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell count is evaluated to determine HSC content prior to transplant. The optimum number of CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells for auto-HSCT is 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/kg of body weight, with 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells/kg being the minimum number required [

 <sup>+</sup> cells infused [
