<p id="Par73">The statistical analysis will be carried out using a Student's 
 <italic>t</italic> test and a chi-square test. A multivariate analysis will be performed to verify the absence of confusion by other variables. In addition, free time of colonisation of the catheter and BSI will be analysed using Kaplan-Meier curves, and they will be compared between both groups by means of the log-rank test (Mantel-Cox test). A value of 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.
