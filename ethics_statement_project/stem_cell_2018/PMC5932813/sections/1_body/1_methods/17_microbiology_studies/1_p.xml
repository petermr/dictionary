<p id="Par74">Samples from the catheter hubs and insertion site will be obtained using sterile swabs and plated in blood agar plates. A qualitative culture of these samples will be performed, and they will be considered positive when the growth of a microorganism is detected. After catheter removal, the terminal portion (5 cm) of the catheter tip will be cultured using the roll-plate technique (Maki's technique) [

Blood cultures will be processed with the usual system in the microbiology laboratories of the participating centres (BACTEC FX, Becton Dickinson, BD, Madrid, Spain). The antibiotic susceptibility will be tested by disc diffusion and microdilution methods following the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (EUCAST) recommendations and breakpoints.
