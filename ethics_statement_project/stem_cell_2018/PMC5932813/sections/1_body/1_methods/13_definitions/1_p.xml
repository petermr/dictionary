<p id="Par62">Significant colonisation of any catheter hub will be defined as the presence of any microbial growth in the qualitative culture of the swabs. CRBSI will be defined as the detection of growth of bacteria or fungi in at least one blood culture obtained from a peripheral vein, associated with clinical signs and symptoms of infection (e.g. fever, chills, and/or hypotension), and no apparent source for BSI other than the CVC. In the case of common skin-colonising microorganisms, such as CNS, two positive sets of blood cultures will be necessary to make the diagnosis of CRBSI. CRBSI attributed to luminal colonisation will be defined as the isolation of identical organisms from the catheter hub and from cultures of separate percutaneously drawn blood specimens; the organism's identity will be proven by molecular typing for patients with BSI due to CNS. Overall, the 30-day case-fatality rate will be defined as death by any cause within the 30Â days following the end of the intervention.</p>
