<p id="Par18">The most frequent mechanism of infection with long-term, non-tunnelled CVC use is catheter hub contamination during catheter manipulation by health personnel, leading to endoluminal colonisation and infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Bacterial colonisation of catheter lumens leads to the development of a microbial consortium associated with the catheter surface and embedded in an extracellular matrix, named biofilm, which hinders antibiotic penetration and bacterial eradication [
