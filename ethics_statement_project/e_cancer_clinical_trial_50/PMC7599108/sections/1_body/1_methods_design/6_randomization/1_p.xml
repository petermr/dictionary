<p id="Par36">The investigator will repot the patient's details to the central registration center via fax. After an eligibility check, the patients will be randomly assigned to receive aspirin plus placebo or aspirin plus metformin at the central registration center by a computer program that will block allocation by age and sex. In this way, the patient assignments will be concealed from the investigator. The randomization center will allocate a numbered treatment pack to each patient, which will contain all the drugs or placebos needed to complete a course of the trial treatment for one patient. Drug allocation was masked from all patients, endoscopists, doctors, and investigators until the end of the trial.</p>
