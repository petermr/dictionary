<p id="Par38">We previously showed that metformin administered at 250 mg/d for 1 year suppressed metachronous adenoma and the effectiveness was similar to previous aspirin chemoprevention trials [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Based on these finding, we estimated that aspirin and metformin have similar chemopreventive effects on colorectal carcinogenesis. Then we estimated that the ACF number would change about − 3 ± 2 (mean ± SD) in the aspirin plus placebo group and − 5 ± 2 (mean ± SD) in the aspirin plus metformin group based on our previous metformin ACF prevention trial [
