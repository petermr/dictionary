<p id="Par35">The secondary outcomes will include (1) the drug safety; adverse events (AEs) will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 4.0. All study participants will be provided with a study diary to record the daily dosage of the study treatment and the AEs. Patients developing grade 3 or more severe AEs will be withdrawn from the study at that point. (2) Effects of additional metformin on the cell-proliferation in the rectal epithelium and polyps: Rectal epithelial samples will be obtained from the same trial patients by biopsy at the time of the first colonoscopy and polypectomy. Cell-proliferative activity will be evaluated by the analysis of the Ki-67 labeling indices. Briefly, immunochromatography will be carried out using a50-fold dilution of the Ki-67 antibody (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) and the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then, we will randomly select six crypts and count the number of Ki67-positive cells per crypt. In total, ~ 250 cells will be counted at a magnification of × 400 using a bright-field microscope. The results will be presented as the percentage of Ki67-positive cells. All participants will undergo a physical examination and laboratory tests at the time of the baseline endoscopic examination and polypectomy.</p>
