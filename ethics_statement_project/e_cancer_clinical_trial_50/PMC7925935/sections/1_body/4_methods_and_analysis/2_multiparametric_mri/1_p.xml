<p>All participants who sign the informed consent will subsequently undergo a 3.0-Tesla mpMRI (Magnetom Skyra, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) with an 18-channel phased-array coil. The sequences of examination mainly included T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (acquired b-values 0, 400, 1000 and 2000 s/mm)
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (with the setting of temporal resolution less than 7 s and 5 min acquisition). Images will be evaluated and scored by one of two expert radiologists (20 and 10 years of experience in prostate MRI) according to PI-RADS V.2.1 criteria.
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The probability of cancer will be assessed by the score from 1 to 5 (1: highly unlikely to be clinically significant cancer, 2: unlikely to be clinically significant cancer, 3: equivocal to be clinically significant cancer, 4: likely to be clinically significant cancer, 5: highly likely to be clinically significant cancer). The MRI report will only be marked as 'not abnormal' or 'less than 3' when scoring 1 or 2, while a specific score will be recorded at a score 3, 4 or 5.
