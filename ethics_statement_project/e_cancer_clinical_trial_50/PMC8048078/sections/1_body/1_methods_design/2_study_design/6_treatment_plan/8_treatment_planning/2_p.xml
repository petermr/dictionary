<p id="Par106">The target coverage goals are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Should the radiation treatment plan not meet the targets below (i.e. falls into “not acceptable” category), the patient will be considered a treatment planning failure and will not be considered for entry into the 3 + 3 dose escalation study. The patient will then be planned at the next highest dose level where an acceptable radiation treatment plan can be generated and followed per the study protocol to assess toxicity. The tumours treated on any treatment day should meet target coverage goals from the isocentres delivered on that treatment day independently of the composite total dose.
