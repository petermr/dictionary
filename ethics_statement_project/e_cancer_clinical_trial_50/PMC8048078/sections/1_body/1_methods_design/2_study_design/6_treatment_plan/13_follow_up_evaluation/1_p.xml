<p id="Par113">Patient will be seen 6 weeks post treatment to evaluate short-term treatment toxicity. If patients cannot travel for this visit (or refuse to travel), an attempt will be made to contact the patient by phone to complete follow-up information. It must be documented if follow-up information is being gathered by telephone. The FACT-G and EQ-5D-5L quality of life questionnaire will be completed at that visit. Further follow-up will be according to physician discretion; a recommended frequency would be every 3 months at minimum. Follow-up investigations will be at the physician's discretion. While routine reimaging is not required, a follow-up CT of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis at 3 months post-treatment or at the time of symptomatic progression is suggested.</p>
