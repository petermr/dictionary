<p id="Par36">The historical standard for early glottic cancer remains the use of 3D-conformal radiotherapy, most commonly using lateral opposing fields, with field size of 5 × 5 cm

Typically, the superior, posterior, inferior and anterior borders of the field are 0.5–1.0 cm above the thyroid notch, 1 cm behind the thyroid cartilage, below the cricoid and 1 cm beyond the patient's external contour, respectively [
