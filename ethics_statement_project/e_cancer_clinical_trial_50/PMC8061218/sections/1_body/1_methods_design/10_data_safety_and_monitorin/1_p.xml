<p id="Par107">A data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) from the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal will be responsible for assessing the safety data. The trial would be interrupted early if higher than expected rates of local recurrences are observed. The DSMB will review interim/cumulative evidence of study related safety, consider factors external to the study when relevant information becomes available and provide the sponsor a recommendation as to whether the study should: continue without change, be modified, suspended or terminated. The DSMB will assess the safety data twice a year. An interim analysis will be planned after the first 55 patients in the experimental arm have a 6-month follow-up. Using a Bayesian probabilistic model, the trial would be interrupted early if higher than expected rates of local recurrences are observed. As this trial involves only a reduction of RT treatment volumes, we do not expect any increase in toxicities in patients treated on the experimental arm.</p>
