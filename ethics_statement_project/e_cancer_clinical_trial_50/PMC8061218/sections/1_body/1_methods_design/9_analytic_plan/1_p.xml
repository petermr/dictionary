<p id="Par105">A Bayesian regression model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] will be used to compare the LC between the VC-RT and CL-RT arms at 2â€‰years. The LC and OS time will be defined from end of RT date. The following recurrences will be considered LC: in field, field margin and within larynx. Local recurrences will be biopsy-proven when possible. Competing events will include local recurrence, regional/distant recurrence and death prior to recurrence. LC will be estimated using both competing risk and Kaplan -Meier (KM) analysis. The analyses will be conducted using SAS and R software. A Cox multivariable regression analysis will be used to determine factors predictive of LC, PFS and OS. Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test will be used to compare the difference in toxicity between arms. For the secondary endpoints of patient-reported outcomes (VHI-10, MDADI and MDASI-HN), trajectory trends of scores between/among arms over time will be explored using a generalized linear mixed model with a random effect of time. Appropriate adjustments for covariates will be considered.
