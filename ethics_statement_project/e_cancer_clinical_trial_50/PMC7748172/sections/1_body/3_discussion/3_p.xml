 </sup> With the extensive evidence supporting the effect of palliative care in the improvement of patient outcomes, a new challenge is to optimize the resources to conduct effective services. EQUIP intervention is jointly developed via the interdisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, and these healthcare professionals have the relevant clinical expertise in locally managing lung cancer patients, involving professional palliative care nurses and care physicians, physiotherapists, and clinical psychologists. This is the first research to confirm the acceptability and feasibility of EQUIP intervention in advanced lung cancer patients. Further high-quality trial is still required to confirm our results.
