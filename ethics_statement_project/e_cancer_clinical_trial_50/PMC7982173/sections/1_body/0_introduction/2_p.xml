<p>As many as 80% of esophageal cancer patients are malnourished.

 </sup> Due to the particularity of tumor location, insufficient nutrition intake and malignant consumption of tumor, negative effects of patients' bad psychological state (such as depression, anxiety, fear, etc.) can lead to negative nutritional balance in patients with esophageal cancer.

 </sup> At present, the treatment of esophageal cancer is still based on surgery combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Postoperative changes in the anatomical pathway of the upper digestive tract, perioperative fasting (usually 5–7 days), surgical trauma stress, absorption of endotoxin and destruction of mucosal barrier lead to the disorder of digestive tract flora, resulting in a series of gastrointestinal complications and aggravating the poor nutritional status of postoperative patients with esophageal cancer.

 </sup> Therefore, gastrointestinal complications are the most important perioperative complications of esophageal cancer. It is particularly important to reduce the incidence and improve the nutritional status after operation.
