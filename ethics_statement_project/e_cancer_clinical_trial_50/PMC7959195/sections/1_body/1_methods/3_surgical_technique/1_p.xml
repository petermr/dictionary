<p>Under general anesthesia, an extraperitoneal working space was first created via a five-port approach, as described by Stolzenburg et al,
 <xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and the prostate, bladder, and endopelvic fascia were exposed. Then the endopelvic fascia was bilaterally incised and dissected towards the apex of prostate at the beginning. Next the puboprostatic ligament was cut and the dorsal venous complex (DVC) was ligated using a 15 cm and barbed thread and then the bladder neck was carefully transected and preserved. After the dissection of seminal vesicles from vas deferens on both sides, it was easy to incise Denonvillier's fascia and dissect it down to the apex of the prostate. Next the vascular pedicle (including NVB) was preserved to the maximum extent for selected patients through Hem-O-Lok clip and the cold scissor was used for incising the prostatic fascia sharply and cutting the urethra in the external urethral sphincter center and the prostate apex while the puboprostatic ligaments were kept. Bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy was carried out for all patients, and the specimens of prostate and lymph nodes were placed in a specimen bag and eventually removed through an umbilical incision.
