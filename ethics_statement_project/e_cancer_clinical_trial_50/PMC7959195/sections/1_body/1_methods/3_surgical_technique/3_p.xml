<p>Urethrovesical anastomosis was the second step of the reconstruction. A running urethrovesical anastomosis using an absorbable barbed suture was performed with the posterior wall suturing from 4 o'clock to 8 o'clock and the front wall suturing from 3 o'clock to 9 o'clock (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3</xref>). The first suture was performed from outside–inside in the right posterior of the neck of the bladder, and this suture was put on the urethral stump section from inside to outside correspondingly. Later, the processes from outside–inside at the neck of the bladder and inside–outside at the urethral stump were in the left of the neck of the bladder repeatedly. The 18F Silastic Foley catheter had been inserted into the bladder gently. When it had been sutured continuously around the neck of the bladder with the order from left to right, the urethrovesical anastomosis had been finished.
