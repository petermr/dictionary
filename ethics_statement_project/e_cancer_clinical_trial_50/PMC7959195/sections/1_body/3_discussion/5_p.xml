<p>After urethral anastomosis, the anterior suspension was started, which is another important step in sandwich reconstruction. Fixation of the neck of the bladder to the pubis is a proposed technique for anterior suspension through putting a bulbourethral stitch or suspending the neck of the bladder along the VUA with/without the ligated DVC to the pubic symphysis. According to some authors, the continence rates were 53%, 73%, and 100% at 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively, compared with the control group rates of 20%, 47%, and 83%, respectively.
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In a meta-analysis, using this bimodal reconstruction increases short-term (defined as 1–12 weeks) and long-term (up to a year after the operation) urinary continence rates. In our study, comparison between the posterior reconstruction and non-reconstruction, patient's outcomes of the urinary continence are 49% vs 24% at 3 months, and 92% vs 79% at 1-year post-RP. Once again, it shows the superiority of using sandwich reconstruction technology. It shows once again that the "Sandwich” technique of the total urethral reconstruction is beneficial to the recovery of early urine continence without affecting urodynamic parameters after RP and increasing complications, such as bleeding, positive margins, and prolonged surgical time.
