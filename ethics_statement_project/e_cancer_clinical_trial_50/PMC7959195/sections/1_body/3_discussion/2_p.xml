<p>The anatomical structures critical to continence were affected to different extents after surgery, which encompassed the muscular components, the urethral components, and the detrusor components.
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Muscular components included the neck of the bladder, internal and external rhabdosphincter, membranous urethra, and puboperinealis as well as pelvic floor muscles, which support structures of the sphincteric complex, such as arcustendinosus, puboprostatic ligament, detrusor apron, denonvilliers’ fascia, and pelvic bones as well as pelvic floor levator ani muscle, and ligaments. The urethral components involved in sphincteric incompetence, which might be caused by the length of the short urethral stump, neural innervations loss, damage to muscle and supporting tissue loss around the potential. The detrusor components involved in denovo bladder instability, detrusor over-activity or hypo-contractility due to damage to nerve or compliance of diminished bladder.
