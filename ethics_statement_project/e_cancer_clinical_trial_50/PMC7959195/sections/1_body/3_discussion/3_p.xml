<p>The preservation of anatomical structures, such as the endopelvic fascia, the detrusor apron nerve through intra-fascial dissecting, and suitable length of urethral membrane contributed to early recovery of urinary continence.
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> It was shown that nerve-preserving bilateral processes can retain the function of motor control of the urethral sphincter, thereby improving postoperative urinary control.
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The detrusor apron, extended from the bladder's interior wall with direct continuity of pubis, had aroused widespread concern recently. The detrusor apron was divided into an anterior, a middle, and a posterior layer anterior to the prostate. The anterior layer passes to the decussated pubococcygeal fibersposteriorly, defuses anteroinferior, and anchors onto the posterior surface of the pubic bone. The middle layer is loose, which connects with the fascial sheath of the dorsal venous complex (DVC). Finally, the posterior layer encloses and extends into the prostate to form the anterior fibromuscular stroma (AFMS) of the prostate.

 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The urethra is also an important anatomical structure with preservation for continence essentially. Generally, the long urethral stump with lateral supporting tissue is critical to reducing the incontinence risk after the operation. It is shown that the membranous urethra retracts proximally immediately after RP while the urethral stump retracts toward the bladder after the urethrovesical anastomosis. Such processes have a negative impact on the functions of the urethral sphincter and the urethral closure pressure. But with time, such changes can be recovered to their preoperative location, and the urethral closure pressure and urinary continence can be recovered.
