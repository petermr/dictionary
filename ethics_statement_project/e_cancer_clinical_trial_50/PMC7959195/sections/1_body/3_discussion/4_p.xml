<p>At present, there are a variety of urethral reconstruction techniques, such as posterior wall reconstruction (represented by Roccostitch) and bladder neck anterior wall suspension and total reconstruction of the vesicourethral anastomosis.

This surgical step mainly targets minimizing urethrosphincteric sliding after RP for supporting VUA, descending the neck of the bladder to the urethral stump closely, and providing enough contraction fulcrum for the rhabdosphincter. It was reported that the rhabdosphincter reconstruction at a posterior position led to continence recovery at an early stage and reduced anastomotic leakage.
