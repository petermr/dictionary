<p>Neither conversion nor re-intervention was found in these 130 cases of Group A and Group B. Similar perioperative data were found in these two groups (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The total operative time, blood loss, duration of the catheter, and post-operative hospital stay were similar to each other in both groups (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), but the time of urethral anastomosis in Group A was longer than that in the other group (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01). The pathological stages and positive surgical margin (PSM) rates with a positive value in these two groups were almost the same as each other (
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the postoperative urinary continence rate of both groups. In Group A, 54.5% of the patients were considered as continent at 2 weeks. Group B was 10.9%. Both groups' differences were significant statistically (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01). At 4 weeks, the percentages of patients who were continent in both groups were 83.3% and 14.1%, which were statistically significantly different (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01). The continence rates at 8 and 12 weeks in Group A were 93.9% and 96.9%, respectively; and the continence rates in Group B were 37.5% and 71.9%, respectively. The continence rates were significant (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01, respectively). We followed up the patients who had urodynamic tests and found that maximum flow rates before and after the "Sandwich” procedure for 12 months were 13.2±2.8 m/s and 15.4±3.6 m/s, respectively, which have a statistical difference (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.034). In addition, residual volumes before and after "Sandwich” procedure for 12 months were 15 (0–20) mL, 0 (0–12.5) mL, which have no statistical difference (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.107).
