<p>Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers for men in the world,
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and radical prostatectomy is an optimal standard method for treating patients who suffer from localized prostate cancer. With the increasing aging of the population in China, the number of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer has been continuously increasing recently.
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> With the development of minimally invasive techniques, LRP or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RALP) has become the preferred surgical method in many large medical centers.
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> These minimally invasive techniques have also achieved good oncological outcomes.

 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Therefore, sexual function and urinary continence after LRP or RALP may be of most concern for both the surgeon and patient. Since the anatomic approach has been introduced to radical prostatectomy (RP), the surgeon has done many surgical innovations to improve urinary continence and sexual function recovery, such as intra-fascial sparing nerve technique
