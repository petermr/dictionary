<p id="Par31">In the infection-level analysis, 10 women (vaccine, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 5; placebo, n = 5) were excluded because of no follow-up after excision treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Finally, 158 women (vaccine, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 82; placebo, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 76) were included in the analysis. There was no significant difference in the distribution of baseline HPV infection between the two groups (Fisher’ exact test: 3.64, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.458). The woman was included in this analysis from the day when the women received an excisional procedure (LEEP or cone) for a first cervical lesion to the day of their last follow-up visit, considering the fact that women could be infected by HPV or had abnormal cytological results for several times after excisional treatment. Among all the infections that treated women had, 71.06% were HR-HPV infection and of these 52.49% were the result of new infections. We observed a significant effect of vaccination on acquiring 14 HR-HPV infection (VE 27.0%; 95%CI 4.9, 44.0%), and a nonsignificant but positive vaccine efficacy estimate of 28.1% (95% CI -62.9,68.3%) for HPV16/18 infection after excision treatment (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Vaccine efficacy against new infections after treatment for 14 HR-HPV infection was estimated to be 32.0% (95%CI 1.8,52.8%), and was 41.2% (95%CI -162.7,86.8%) for HPV-16/18 infection, which was consistently positive in this restricted analysis but didn’t reach statistical significance.
