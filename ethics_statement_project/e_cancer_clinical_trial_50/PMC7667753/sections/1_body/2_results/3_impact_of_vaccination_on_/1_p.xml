<p id="Par34">15 women (vaccine, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 7; placebo, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 8) were excluded because of no cytological results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Finally, 153 women were included in the final analysis (vaccine, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 80; placebo, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 73). The distribution of cytological results at baseline was similar between two groups (Fisher' exact test: 8.80, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.051). In this analysis, the follow-up time was defined as the duration from the day of excisional procedure to the day of ascertainment of the subsequent disease end point (LSIL+ incidence), while for women without a subsequent disease end point, until the day of their last follow-up visit. The median follow-up time was 46.0 months among women who were treated. The median follow-up time for vaccine group and placebo group were 48.5 months, 44.0 months, respectively. The vaccine efficacy for the occurrence of LSIL+ was 55.3% (95%CI -12.1, 82.2%), irrespective of HPV DNA types. There was no significant difference between two groups (
