  <p>Note: Permanently discontinue for any severe or Grade 3 drug-related AE that recurs or any life-threatening event</p>
  <p>
   <sup>a</sup> For participants who begin treatment with Grade 2 AST or ALT at Cycle 1 Day 1 of treatment, if AST or ALT increases by greater than or equal to 50% relative to baseline and lasts for at least 1 week then participants should be discontinued
  </p>
  <p>
   <sup>b</sup> If symptoms resolve within one hour of stopping IMP infusion, the infusion may be restarted at 50% of the original infusion rate (e.g., from 100 mL/hr. to 50 mL/hr). Otherwise dosing will be held until symptoms resolve and the participant should be pre-medicated for the next scheduled dose
  </p>
  <p>
   <sup>c</sup> Participants with intolerable or persistent Grade 2 drug-related AE may hold study medication at PI/delegate discretion
