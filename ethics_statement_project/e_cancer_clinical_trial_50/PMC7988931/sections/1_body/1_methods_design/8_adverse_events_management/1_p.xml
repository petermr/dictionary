<p id="Par50">Adverse events (both non-serious and serious) of unknown aetiology, associated with IMP exposure and likely to have an immune-mediated underlying mechanism may be considered as irAEs. These AEs may occur from soon after the first dose to months after the last dose. If an irAE is suspected, efforts will be put in place to exclude any other etiologic causes prior to labelling an AE as an irAEs. Summaries of recommendations to managing irAEs and of the physician's guidelines for IMP's temporary interruption and permanent discontinuation in case of toxicities are provided in Table

 <bold>.</bold> Treatment discontinuation for AST, ALT deterioration in participants who present with Grade 2 AST or ALT at Cycle 1 Day 1 will be triggered only if ALT or AST increase by more than or equal to 50% compared to the measurement taken at initiation of systemic treatment (Cycle 1 Day 1) and lasts for at least 1 week. In addition to the guidelines, dosing should be permanently discontinued in any participant who does not receive the Cycle 2 dose within the allowed window (Day 18 to Day 24) due to being unfit for dosing for any reason.
