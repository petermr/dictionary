<p id="Par51">Statistical analyses will include an intent to treat (ITT) analysis including all participants enrolled and a per protocol analysis using all participants who complete the study without major protocol violations. Descriptive analyses will be performed by cross-tabulating relevant predictors (e.g. demographic variables) and endpoints. Appropriate statistical tests will be carried out, such as Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon tests for continuous variables. Univariable regression analyses will also be performed to estimate regression coefficients and their 95% confidence intervals. Data analysis will occur when the study is complete. Interim analyses of safety data will be conducted at the end of FU1 and at the end of FU2. The comprehensive statistical analysis plan will be finalised prior to the final analysis.</p>
