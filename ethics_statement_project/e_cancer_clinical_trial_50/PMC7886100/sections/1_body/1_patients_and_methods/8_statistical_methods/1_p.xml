<p>All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 21.0 and Graphpad Prism 8.0.2 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). The level of significance for all statistical tests was set at 0.05 (
 <italic>α</italic>=0.05). Data are presented as means and standard deviations (Mean±SD) for continuous variables and as proportions for categorical variables. Median and quartile were used in skewed distribution data. The continuous variables were assessed using Student's 
 <italic>t</italic>-test when Gaussian distribution is verified. Otherwise Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used alternatively. The association between categorical variables were assessed using Chi-squared test (
 <italic>Χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>). The ordinal variables were assessed using Wilcoxon rank sum test. Analysis of variance will be used if Gaussian distribution is verified in repeated measurement data; if not, the generalized estimating equation will be used. A two-tailed 
 <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.
