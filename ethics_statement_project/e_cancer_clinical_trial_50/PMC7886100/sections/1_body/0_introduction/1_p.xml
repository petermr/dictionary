<p>In 2018, gastric cancer was the fifth most prevalent cancer and ranked third in cancer-related mortality.

Opioid is a cornerstone in clinical analgesia though adverse outcomes such as respiratory depression, misuse have attracted out attentions in recent years. In pain management, multimodal analgesia emphasizes the combination of analgesics with different mechanisms and techniques to minimize the opioids use and side effects.
