Nowadays, acupuncture has derived new forms, such as electroacupuncture (EA), transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS), etc. Among them, TEAS evolved on the basis of EA with similar efficacy

So, the objective of this trial was to validate the efficacy of TEAS on postoperative recovery in patients after gastrectomy. In addition, we also hope to explore molecular interpretations of TEAS in this trial.
