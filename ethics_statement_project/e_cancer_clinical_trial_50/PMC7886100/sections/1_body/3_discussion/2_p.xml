<p>Pain management plays a particularly important role in the rehabilitation process. ERAS emphasizes the necessity of effective pain relief targeting the trauma-induced stress.
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> What's the basis of postoperative pain? Surgery is a nociceptive trigger of tissue or nerve injury. These pro-inflammatory factors will unbalance various cytokines in microenvironment and then bring about changes in inflammatory immune response which will mediate peripheral and central sensitization, and hence that will affect the body's pain threshold, and cause neuropathic and inflammatory pain, not just mechanical pain. So, there is a close correlation between pain, inflammation and immunomodulation.
