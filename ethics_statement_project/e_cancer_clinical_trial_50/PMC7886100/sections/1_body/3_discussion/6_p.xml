<p>So, superficially it may be another explanation that the anti-nociceptive effects of TEAS may through its regulation of inflammation. Based on what we mentioned above, we think that it may come down to the immunomodulation of TEAS. As we all know, it's extremely common that patients with gastric cancer have immune dysfunction. Stress reactions of varying extent caused by operation, anesthesia and pain will further lead to immunosuppression.
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Previous studies have proved that EA has immunomodulatory effect and it can enhance cellular immunity of patients with malignant tumors.
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> IL-2 plays an important role in promoting lymphocytes maturation and regulating immunity. The production of IL-2 may be inhibited by some negative regulatory molecules which are generated under traumatic stress and hence it results in the decline of immunity. Some scholars have found that EA can promote the production of IL-2, weaken inflammatory factors, and reduce the extent of immunosuppression.
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Now it was verified that TEAS has a similar efficacy on protecting the immunity. In mechanisms, there may be a cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis involved in the inflammatory reflex to achieve immune homeostasis.
