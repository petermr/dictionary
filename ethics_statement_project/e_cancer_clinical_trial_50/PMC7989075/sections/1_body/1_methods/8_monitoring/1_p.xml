<p id="Par48">Throughout the trial, a trained, qualified, and independent monitor will periodically visit each participating center in order to randomly check compliance with the protocol, compliance with in- and exclusion criteria, proper implementation, conduct of Informed Consent procedures, Source Data Verification (i.e. crosscheck data in ALEA with patient dossier and vice versa), and reporting of serious adverse events (SAEs). Adverse events are graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. SAE's defined as adverse events grade 3, 4, or 5 are collected. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) are reported to the Competent Authority and Ethics Committee according to national regulation. In addition to the expedited reporting of SUSARs, the sponsor submits a safety report to the Competent Authority and Ethics Committee once a year during the clinical trial. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) monitors the safety of the trial subjects by qualitative analyses of feasibility, accrual rate, mortality, and SAE'S after 50 and 100 patients have completed treatment.
