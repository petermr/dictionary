<p>The correspondence author oriented the first author as a research assistant regarding the study processes prior to the commencement of this study. The research assistant worked as a registered dental hygienist for 5 years in a dental clinic, was a doctoral candidate, and was blinded to the participants' assignment to groups. The training lasted 3 hours daily over 5 days—and included the oral health education and measurement of variables related to this study. In addition, the correspondence author observed the research assistant periodically to ensure that education and measurement was performed correctly throughout the study.</p>
