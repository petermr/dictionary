<p>The oral examination was assessed at baseline and 6 months after radiotherapy with disposable plane mirror and World Health Organization (WHO) probe (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL). Dental caries experience, plaque score (PS), bleeding on probing (BOP), and salivary flow rate were evaluated by an experienced dentist. Dental caries was defined by WHO criteria.

 </sup> The mean number of caries experience (decayed, missing due to caries, and filled due to caries) were calculated. O'Leary indices were examined to assess quantity of plaque. This index was calculated by dividing the number of plaque tooth surfaces by the total number of available tooth surfaces and multiplying by 100. BOP was measured at 6 sites (mesio-buccal, mid-buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual/palatal, mid-lingual/palatal, and disto-lingual/palatal) per tooth for all teeth, excluding third molars. The percentage of BOP was calculated by dividing the number of sites with bleeding on probing by the number of sites explored and multiplying this value by 100. The stimulated whole saliva samples were obtained by chewing on wax blocks (Dentocult SM kits, Orion Diagnostica Co. Ltd, Epsom, Finland) for 5 minutes. Salivary flow rate was measured in ml/minutes.
