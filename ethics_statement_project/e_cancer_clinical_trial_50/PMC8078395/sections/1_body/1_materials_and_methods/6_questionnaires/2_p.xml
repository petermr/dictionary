 </sup> These questionnaires were completed during follow-up appointments in person. The results of the QoL questionnaires were analyzed according to the specific scoring manual provided by the EORTC,
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]
 </sup> all scores were expressed on a scale ranging between 0 to 100. The EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 questionnaire consists of 7 multi-item symptom scales (pain, sensory problems, social contact problems, swallowing, social eating problems, speech problems, and reduced sexuality) and 11 single-item symptom scales (nutritional supplement use, mouth opening problems, teeth problems, coughing, painkiller use, weight loss, weight gain, sticky saliva, feeding tube, dry mouth, and feeling ill). Most items were rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 ("not at all”) to 4 ("very much”); 5 components used a binary response set ("yes” or "no”). Higher scores in the symptom scale amount to a higher level of symptomatology and a poor QoL.
