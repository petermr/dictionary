<p>A "quasi-experimental case-control study design‚Äù is a between-subjects design in which participants have not been randomly assigned to conditions. If at the end of the study there was a difference in the 2 groups' oral health outcome, it might be strong evidence for the efficacy of the intervention. However, providing treatment intervention to the experimental group, while providing control intervention to the control group at the same time, may not be blinded to both the patients and the investigators. Moreover, giving different intervention to the patients undergoing cancer therapy may affect the patients' psychological state and this could be an important confounding of the study results. Therefore, the first year participants of our study were assigned to control group, and the next year were assigned to experimental group. This type of allocation made sure that the experimental and control groups did not overlap each other during study period, and at least, the participants were able to be blinded to the test.</p>
