<p>The best predictor of lung cancer is smoking duration and intensity. It is expressed as the number of cigarettes per day for a given number of years ("pack years”, 1 pack = 20 cigarettes, 1 pack-year = 20 cigarettes daily for 1 year). Various thresholds have been used with a range from 15 pack-years up to 30 pack-years.

 </sup> Greater risk means better efficacy of screening. The pause from becoming a non-smoker was determined between 10 and 15 years in various studies, for it is known that after this period the risk of developing lung cancer decreases. The recommendations of the CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel Report recommend a threshold of 30 pack-years and &lt;15 years from the cessation of smoking.
