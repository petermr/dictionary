  <p>The number and proportion of eligibility from the Rotterdam Study population for ongoing clinical phase III trials on a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. White bars indicate data from the first analysis; black bars indicate data from the second analysis. The difference between these two analyses is the operationalization, and thus inclusion or exclusion, of the eligibility criteria '(un)stable disease', 'acute course of disease', or 'other condition increasing risk of participation'.
