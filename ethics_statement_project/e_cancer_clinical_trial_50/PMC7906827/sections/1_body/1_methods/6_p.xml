<p id="Par10">We performed two complementary analyses and calculated the abovementioned proportions in each analysis separately. These two analyses differed with respect to the interpretation of an eligibility criterion that was not always explicitly specified in the various trial protocols. This criterion was often stated as follows: ‘
 <italic>preexisting (un)stable disease</italic>’, ‘
 <italic>an acute course of disease</italic>’, or ‘
 <italic>other medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk of study participation or, in the investigator’s judgment, make the participant inappropriate for the study</italic>’. In our dataset, we operationalized this criterion as follows: diagnosis of dementia, diagnosis of moderate to severe COPD, current clinically significant depressive symptoms, abnormal kidney function, current liver disease (defined as liver steatosis, and liver cirrhosis) or a new diagnosis within the preceding three months for the following conditions: stroke, cancer, (including antineoplastic agents), diabetes mellitus, COPD, cardiac disease (heart failure, myocardial infarct, atrial fibrillation, and revascularisation). In the first analysis, we included everyone as eligible, who met this operationalization and in the second analysis, we excluded anyone who met this operationalization. The general characteristics of individuals with or without acute or unstable disease are presented in Online Resource Tables 2 and 3).
