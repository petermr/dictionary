<p id="Par15">In a middle-aged and elderly population in the Netherlands from predominantly West-European descent, we found that 97% of this population would be eligible to participate in any of the nine currently ongoing vaccine trials against SARS-CoV-2. For persons at high-risk of severe COVID-19, the eligibility for any trial was 96%.
