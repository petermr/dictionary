<p id="Par12">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> presents the exclusion criteria from the 9 included trials, and we note that seven of these mentioned the eligibility criterion of ‘acute’ or ‘unstable preexisting’ disease without further specification. Therefore, we performed two analyses to calculate the proportion of the eligible participants for each trial. In the first analysis, we included all eligible participants, including those who met our operationalization of the eligibility criterion of ‘acute’ or ‘unstable preexisting’ in the seven trials that mentioned this criterion without further specification. In the second analysis, we repeated the first analysis but now excluding those who met our operationalization of ‘acute’ or ‘unstable preexisting’ criterion.
