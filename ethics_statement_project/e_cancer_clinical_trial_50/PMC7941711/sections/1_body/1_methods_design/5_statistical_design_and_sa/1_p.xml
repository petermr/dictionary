<p id="Par29">This aim of this study is to estimate the 2 year relapse-free survival rate (RFS) for each study arm with sufficient clinical precision. The statistical comparison of the difference in RFS between the two arms is not a primary aim. We designed the sample size to estimate the 2-year-RFS with the accuracy determined to be the width of the 95% confidence interval for the 2 year-RFS to be less than 20%. The 2-year RFS was expected to be 65%. Assuming an estimate at the 95% confidence interval for the 2 year-RFS with the Wilson's method, 84 patients are necessary for each arm. Estimating around 10% drop outs, we set the total number of patients to be 190. The above sample size was set to assure the statistical power to quantitatively compare the primary point between the arms. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the clinical significance of the S1 monotherapy by integrating the observed data of the RFSs, QOL and adverse events of the two arms.</p>
