<p id="Par31">Since 2004, cisplatin with vinorelbine has been the preferred treatment for patients who have undergone complete resection of stage II to IIIA NSCLC and the recommended regimen has not been changed in more than 16 years. Because the adverse reactions are severe in the cisplatin with vinorelbine regime, the Lung Cancer Group in Kyusyu (LOGIK) is conducting the LOGIK1702 study in order to compare the efficacy of milder chemotherapy using S-1 compared to the standard regimen of cisplatin with vinorelbine. S-1 chemotherapy has been successfully used for other cancers and is recommended for intestinal adjuvant chemotherapy. In previous studies using cisplatin doublet based adjuvant chemotherapies most of the relapses occurred within 2-years following the operation and the survival curve came to a plateau thereafter [

The other aspect of this study is to evaluate work productivity and activity, and quality of adjusted life years (QALY) by using the questionnaire of the EQ-5D-5L, which was configured as a secondary endpoint. The EQ-5D-5L measures five aspects of the patient's life: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Accordingly, the patients' QALY will be expressed numerically and evaluated objectively. Since better QOL and work productivity are also desired even for postoperative patients, this analysis will evaluate another aspect of the adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to prognosis. Quality of life is important as well as the longevity prognosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective study which evaluates the QALY and work productivity in postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.
