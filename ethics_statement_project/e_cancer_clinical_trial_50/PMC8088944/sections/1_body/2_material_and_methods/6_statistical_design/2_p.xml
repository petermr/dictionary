<p>SWOG's standard design (attained design) was used to determine the number of patients enrolled in the study. The null hypothesis stated that the overall RR would be less than 5% and the alternative hypothesis stated that the overall RR would be greater than 30%; the α error was determined to be 5% (one‐tailed), and the β error was determined to be 20% (one‐tailed). The alternative hypothesis was established based on data from previous reports. The sample size was set to 13 cases. The median survival time and corresponding 95% CIs for OS and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan‐Meier method. Progression‐free survival was defined as the time from day 1 of cycle 1 until the first event (progressive disease or death by any cause). If no such event occurred, data for that patient were censored on the day of the last imaging procedure. Overall survival was defined as the time from day 1 of cycle 1 until death by any cause. If death did not occur, data were censored on the last day of survival confirmation. All analyses were undertaken using SPSS version 21.0 (IBM).</p>
