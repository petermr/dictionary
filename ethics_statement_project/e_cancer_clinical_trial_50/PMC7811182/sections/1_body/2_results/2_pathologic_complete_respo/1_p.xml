<p>Breast cancer NAC response and the accuracy of MRI-guided biopsy for diagnosing a pCR are given in 
 <xref rid="zoi201035t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Of the 20 patients with evaluable data, surgical pathology results demonstrated residual invasive cancer in 8 patients (40%), ductal carcinoma in situ but no invasive cancer in 1 patient (5%), and no residual invasive or in situ cancer in 11 patient (55%). The NPV of MRI-guided biopsy for diagnosing a pCR was 92.8% (95% CI, 66.2%-99.8%) when pCR definition 1 was used and 85.8% (95% CI, 57.2%-98.1%) when pCR definition 2 was used. When pCR definition 1 was used, there was 1 false-negative MRI-guided biopsy result for which surgical pathology findings demonstrated less than 0.02 cm of residual invasive disease. This patient's pre-NAC tumor measured 5.4 cm, which is larger than the median tumor size of 3.0 cm. When pCR definition 2 was used, there was a second false-negative MRI-guided biopsy result for which surgical pathology findings demonstrated residual ductal carcinoma in situ. This patient's pre-NAC tumor measured 2.4 cm, which also is smaller than the median.
