<p>We present herein the results of a feasibility study that suggest the potential utility of MRI-guided biopsy to identify pCR after NAC. This nonrandomized controlled trial’s results suggest that the accuracy of MRI-guided biopsy to diagnose a post-NAC pCR approaches that of reference-standard surgical resection in this small cohort. With an increasing focus on mitigating overtreatment and limiting potential toxic effects and cost, MRI-guided biopsy may be a viable alternative to surgical resection for appropriately selected patients after NAC. These preliminary results support the need for further study of our novel method that uses MRI-guided biopsy.</p>
