 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> found that after receiving a bolus 1.5 mg/kg before induction of anesthesia in patients undergoing cesarean section, 1.5 mg/kg/h was continuously pumped with lidocaine, and the blood concentration rises to (2.05±0.42) μg/mL; Sahmeddini
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> with a bolus of 1.5 mg/kg followed by continuous infusion of lidocaine at 2.0 mg/kg/h until the end of the operation, the blood concentration of lidocaine is 1.0–2.0 μg/mL during the entire operation period. The currently recommended regimen for intravenous application of lidocaine is 1.0–2.0 mg/kg for continuous infusion after a bolus of 1.0–2.0 mg/kg/h. At this time, the blood concentration of lidocaine was far lower than the concentration of 5.0 μg/mL that produces toxic reactions and is therefore considered to be safe.
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> During this trial, none of the patients had lidocaine-related adverse events. Furthermore, in this trial, there was no significant difference in the hemodynamics between the two groups of patients at various time points, which would not significantly affect the patient's intraoperative hemodynamics. Therefore, this dose of lidocaine can be safely used in ordinary patients.
