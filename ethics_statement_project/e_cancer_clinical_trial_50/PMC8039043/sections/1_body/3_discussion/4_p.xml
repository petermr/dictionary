<p>There are still some limitations to this trial. This trial only included patients between 45 and 65 years of age, and the incidence of lung cancer is gradually becoming "younger”. The sample size was small, and therefore a multi-center, large-sample prospective randomized controlled clinical trial is required to confirm the result. Moreover, this trial did not explore the dose–effect relationship between lidocaine and postoperative recovery quality and lung protection.</p>
