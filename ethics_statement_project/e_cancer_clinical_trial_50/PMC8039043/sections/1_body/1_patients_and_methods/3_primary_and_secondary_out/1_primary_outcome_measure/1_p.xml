<p>The primary outcome measure of this study was the QoR-40 score. This was measured 24 h after surgery using the QoR-40 questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of 40 questions assessing 5 aspects of the patient's recovery including the degree of physical comfort, pain, physical independence, psychological support, and emotional state. Each domain is quantified using a 5-point rating scale whereby 1 indicates never, 2 sometimes, 3 frequently, 4 most, and 5 always. The QoR-40 score ranges from 40 to 200, with 200 being the best and 40 being the worst. All patients received the questionnaire assessment 24 h postoperatively.</p>
