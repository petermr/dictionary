<p>Randomization of subjects to 2 groups will be on the basis of a concealed allocation approach using statistical analysis PROCPLAN statements (SAS 9.4; World Headquarters SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). A computer-generated list of random numbers will be used to determine the allocation of the participants, with numbered opaque sealed envelopes containing the randomization schedule. The envelopes will be kept by an investigator who is not an assessor in the study and will be informed of the outcomes at the end of the study. In this trial, participants and acupuncture practitioners cannot be blinded. The researchers recording the outcomes and those making the conclusions will be all blinded to patients' assessments.</p>
