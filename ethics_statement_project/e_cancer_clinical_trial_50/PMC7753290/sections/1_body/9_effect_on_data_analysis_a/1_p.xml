<p>Although all patients completed the randomised component of trial treatment by 29 February 2020, delays and alterations to maintenance therapy may not have affected the two arms equally. PIs may be potentially biased to alter treatment based on local COVID‐19 clusters and patients’ favourable MM response. Therefore, sensitivity analyses will be performed with and without the inclusion of affected patients to assess the significance of the measures taken on patient outcomes. Secondary outcomes will also be assessed as originally intended in both pre‐ and post‐COVID‐19 scenarios.</p>
