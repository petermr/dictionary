<p>Furthermore, the NCT02489357 pilot study interrogated the 'cryo-immunological response' with PD-1 blockade using the antibody (pembrolizumab) in addition to cytoreductive cryotherapy.
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> In total, 12 men with oligometastatic disease initiated 8 months of ADT and pembrolizumab, with subsequent whole-gland cryotherapy.
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Primary endpoint was PSA &lt;0.6 ng/mL at 1 year, and this was met in 42% (n=5). Median PFS was 14 months and median systemic therapy-free survival was 17.5 months.
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> There were no grade 3 adverse events, with grade 1 (non-pad, occasional) urinary incontinence in 16.7% (n=2).
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> This profile is in keeping with the favourable early functional outcomes from cryotherapy in patients with non-metastatic disease.
 <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> With regard to safety, there were no reported cases of rectal injury or fistulae in either study.
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 53</xref> In both studies, men did not receive prior systemic therapy escalation and thus the 'additive' value of cytoreductive cryotherapy in such a cohort remains unclear.
