 <italic>de novo</italic> oligometastatic disease, a single pilot study including 20 men underwent sequential systemic therapy (ADT), surgery (cytoreductive radical prostatectomy+PLND±RPLND) and consolidation SABR to visible bone metastasis.
 <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> A novel endpoint of 'undetectable PSA (&lt;/=0.05 ng/mL) following testosterone recovery' was used and achieved in 20% (n=4). However, 95% (n=19) achieved an undetectable PSA, irrespective of testosterone suppression, after all three treatments. The addition of SABR accounted for an undetectable PSA in 21% (4/19) of this subgroup of men, when treatments were analysed separately.
