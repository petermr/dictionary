<p>This has led to a comparison to the ‘self-seeding’ hypothesis, as described in other solid organ malignancies involving the breast and colon.
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> It posits that the return of CTCs or DTCs from distant secondary sites alters the primary tumour microenvironment, via release of matrix metalloproteinases (eg, matrix metalloproteinase-1) and cytokines (eg, CXC-motif chemokine 1).
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> Such circulation may lead not only to ‘self-seeding’ but also the remodelling of a ‘pre-metastatic niche’ at new distant sites.
