<p>Immune-mediate responses may not be limited to cytotoxic radiotherapy, with minimally invasive ablative therapy effects, such as the ‘cryo-immunological response’, also proposed.
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Similar to the cytotoxic abscopal response, the clinical translation of such observed responses is unclear.
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Early local prostate cryotherapy case series reported spontaneous distant regression of metastasis, although this has not been replicated in the contemporary literature.
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 32</xref> Furthermore, clinical augmentation of prostate cryotherapy by immune-checkpoint inhibitors (eg, anti-programmed cell death-1 antibody, PD-1) also demonstrated preclinical promise, but proved disappointing when translated into early phase clinical studies.
