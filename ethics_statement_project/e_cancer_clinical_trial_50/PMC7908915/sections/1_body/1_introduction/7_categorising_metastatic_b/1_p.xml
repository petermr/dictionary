<p>A key research barrier at present is that there is no universally accepted definition for oligometastatic disease, which varies depending on the anatomical site (nodal, burden, visceral), absolute number (1 to 7), spatial pattern (outside vertebral bodies or pelvis) and diagnostic imaging used (conventional or molecular).
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Consequently, there is also no accepted definition for 'high' versus 'low' volume disease.
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 36 37</xref> At present, oncology trials exploring systemic therapy have frequently adopted the use of the Chemohormonal Therapy Versus Androgen Ablation Randomized Trial for Extensive Disease (CHAARTED) definition of metastatic disease burden. High burden disease is defined as visceral metastasis and/or four or more bone metastases with at least one or more metastasis located outside the vertebral bodies or pelvis.
