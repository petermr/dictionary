<p>The HORRAD phase III trial randomised 432 men to ADT with or without local prostate radiotherapy.
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> In accordance with STAMPEDE, no significant difference in OS was observed between the two groups (median 45 months in experimental arm vs 43 months with ADT alone; HR 0.90 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.14); p=0.40), although there was a non-significant trend towards improved OS in the 160 patients with low volume metastatic disease treated with radiotherapy (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.10). This study, however, was criticised for its lack of prespecified metastatic burden (including no knowledge of visceral disease) and potential underpowered sample size.
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Both trials took place at a time when upfront systemic agents had not been fully introduced and thus the true ‘additive’ effect of local prostate radiotherapy in a contemporary cohort remains unclear.
