<p id="Par47">We keep following with global trend. Result from JCOG 1104 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which is randomized trial comparing four and eight courses of adjuvant S-1, confirmed that 1-year's S-1 treatment should be the standard adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II gastric cancer. The trial also suggested S-1 monotherapy still needs to be further optimized. The ARTIST2 trial [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] include patients with stage II and III gastric cancer, suggesting that SOX is superior to S-1 monotherapy, but the subgroup data still not be avaliable and the outcomes for patients with stage III is unknown. JACCRO GC07 trial [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] showed that the addition of docetaxel to S-1 is effective in patients with stage III gastric cancer. Compared with S-1 monotherapy, the 3-year RFS improved from 50 to 66%, Although these studies have proved XELOX may not be the optimal regimen in other countries, but in China we can not fully accept considering different patients characteristic, so the further investigation is necessary. We conduct this trial aimed at in patients with stage III disease, expect to expand and optimize the existing therapies. And the trial of comparison with docetaxel combined S-1 and SOX may also be carried out in combination with our research process.
