<p id="Par45">The efficacy analysis will be performed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The DFS will be calculated from the randomization date to the first detected disease recurrence date. The following events are defined as recurrence: primary cancer recurrence, newly diagnosed gastric cancer, and death. The OS will be calculated from the randomization date to the date of death or the date of last follow-up. Survival rates will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the differences between survival curves will be tested using the log-rank test. An accurate 95% confidence interval of the overall survival and safety analysis will be estimated. All statistical tests will be two-sided tests. A significant difference will be considered when 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt; 0.05. The risk ratio will be estimated using a stratified Cox regression model. In this study, 616 patients are expected to be enrolled. An interim analysis is planned when the number of events will reach 117. This clinical trial will be terminated under the condition that the 95% confidence interval (CI) of HR spans 1 and P&gt;α=0.0084. The overall test level of this study is α=0.05 (two-sided) according to the O'Brien Flemming method, and α distribution is performed based on the number of endpoint events collected during the interim analysis. The mid-term analysis α will be 0.0084, and the significant level of the final analysis will be α=0.0468. The results of efficacy and safety will be reviewed by the external data monitoring committee to determine whether the study should continue, according to predetermined criteria.
