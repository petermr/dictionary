<p>Neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCTX) improve patients' survival in curative treatment of non-metastatic oesophageal cancer and have become the standard of care in Western Europe.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In these multimodal oncological protocols, curative surgery is carried out after neoadjuvant treatment by oesophagectomy. However, oesophagectomy implicates postoperative mortality rates between 6% and 11% and postoperative morbidity rates range from 60% to 80%.
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref> In recent years, neoadjuvant therapy has become increasingly effective, with 16%–49% of patients showing no tumour cells in the operative specimens.
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref> This high locoregional histopathological complete response rate imposes a need to identify complete responder and avoid potentially unnecessary and harmful surgery in this population. Considering that neoadjuvant treatment without surgery is effective for a large proportion of patients, more individual/personalised treatment options based on surveillance and surgery only if needed are highly relevant for patients with non-metastatic oesophageal cancer.
