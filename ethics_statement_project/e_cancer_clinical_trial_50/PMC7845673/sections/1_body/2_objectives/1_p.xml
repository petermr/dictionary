<p>We aim to perform a scoping review as part of the development phase for a prospectively planned multicentre randomised controlled trial, addressing 'Surgery as needed vs surgery on principle in patients with post-neoadjuvant complete response of oesophageal cancer' (Prospective registration identifier of the clinical trial will be DRKS00022801. Registration is currently in process and will be completed after we have incoperated the results of the scoping review). The scoping review will allow us to finally define and adapt the research question and methodology of the following randomised trial taking into account the findings (such as research gaps and/or methodological pitfalls) in the currently available pool of primary studies addressing this or very similar questions.</p>
