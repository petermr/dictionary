<p>Currently in Western Europe the majority of patients with non-metastatic resectable oesophageal cancer are treated with nCTX or nCRT plus consecutive surgery. Despite postneoadjuvant pathological complete response rates between 16% and 49%, surgery is carried out in all patients and independent of the results of post-neoadjuvant response evaluation.

Using a randomised study design, we aim to optimise therapeutic outcomes by personalisation of the therapeutic sequence. According to the current evidence and also supported by our clinical experience, it is likely that a subgroup of pathological complete responders (with consecutive omission of potentially harmful surgery) will be identified.
