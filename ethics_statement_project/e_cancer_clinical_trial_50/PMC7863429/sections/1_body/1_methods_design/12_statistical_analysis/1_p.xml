<p id="Par109">Sample size calculation: 196 patients will be randomized between 2 arms (in a 1:1 ratio). The primary endpoint is the 1-year Progression Free Survival (PFS). In the standard arm, the expected progression-free survival at 1â€‰year is 30% (10% for lung cancer, 50% for breast cancer and 30% for prostatic cancers). In the experimental arm, we anticipate a 20% absolute increase (i.e. 30, 70 and 50%, respectively). According to Freedman's method, accepting a two-tailed type I error of 5% and an 80% power (type II error of 20%), 178 patients (2 X 89) need to be recruited and 106 events need to be observed for the primary analysis. Assuming a 10% withdrawal rate, a total of 196 patients will need to be included.</p>
