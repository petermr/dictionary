<p id="Par92">The organs at risk (OAR) of complication include all normal tissues located in the vicinity of the target or in the beams path. Specific dose-volumes constraints, defined by Timmermann, have to be respected to avoid unacceptable toxicity [

As for the spinal cord, two volumes have to be delineated: A "conventional” volume is delineated on the simulation CT after registration of MRI (T2-weighted and T1-weighted with contrast). The contour should be drawn at least 10 cm above and below the CTV, as recommended by NRG Oncology protocols. A "partial” volume is specific to the present study (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The contour drawn as above ("conventional” volume) extends 5–6 mm above and below the CTV [
