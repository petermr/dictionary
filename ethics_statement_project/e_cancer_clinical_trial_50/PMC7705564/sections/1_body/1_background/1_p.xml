<p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> In Japan, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 75%–85% of all lung cancers.
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Although there have been no randomised controlled trials to compare surgery with radiation therapy or chemotherapy, observational studies have suggested that surgery is the most curative treatment for lung cancer.
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> However, surgery alone may not be a sufficient treatment because an observational study of 11 663 surgically treated patients with NSCLC showed that the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate in all patients was 69.6%, while the rates in patients with clinical stage IA, IB, IIA and IIB were 82.0%, 66.1%, 54.5% and 46.1%, respectively.
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Even in completely resected cases, approximately 50% of patients showed local metastasis and/or distant metastases due to micrometastasis.
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> Thus, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy has been performed. In Japan, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy regimens include tegafur–uracil combination therapy for pathological stage IA3 and IB,
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> and cisplatin combination chemotherapy for pathological stage II–IIIA.
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref> Although postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy can only improve the 5-year OS rate by 4%–5%,
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–12</xref> the use of cytotoxic anticancer drugs during the postoperative phase may be associated with deterioration of the patient's quality of life. Therefore, it is important to establish a new perioperative treatment to prevent recurrence and maintain quality of life.
