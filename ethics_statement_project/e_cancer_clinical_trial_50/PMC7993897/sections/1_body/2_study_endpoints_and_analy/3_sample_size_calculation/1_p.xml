<p id="Par63">The sample size was estimated using the principles of an A-Hern design powered for 39% of ongoing response at 24 months. In order to be able to reject 29% under the alternative of 39% with a one-sided type I error of 5 and 90% power, 190 patients will be needed. Criterion for success according to the A'Hern design would be that at least 66 patients out of 190 patients continue to experience a response at 24 months after the first start of treatment. However, the primary test will be done using the lower boundary of the one-sided 95% CI of the Kaplan-Meier estimate of PFS from the start of treatment (which in this patient population is equivalent to an ongoing response) at 24 months to be able to account for possible drop-out or censoring before this time point. Taking a safety margin of 5% for lost to follow-up, the total sample size will be fixed at 200 patients.</p>
