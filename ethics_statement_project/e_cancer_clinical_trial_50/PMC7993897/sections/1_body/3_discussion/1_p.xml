<p id="Par66">In this nationwide Safe Stop trial, the treatment regimen is optimised for individual patients with advanced melanoma by early discontinuation of first-line monotherapy with PD-1 blockers (i.e. nivolumab and pembrolizumab) upon achieving confirmed response (CR or PR) according to RECIST v1.1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. All fourteen Dutch melanoma centres will participate to prospectively evaluate whether it is safe to stop first-line PD-1 treatment early. The primary endpoint is the rate of ongoing response, which will be assessed at 24â€‰months after initial start of first-line monotherapy PD-1 blockade. To evaluate patients' well-being, HRQoL will be collected periodically.
