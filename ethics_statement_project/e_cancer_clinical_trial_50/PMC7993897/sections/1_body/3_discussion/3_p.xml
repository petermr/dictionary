<p id="Par68">To ensure feasibility and nationwide implementation, the study was designed according to procedures of current clinical practice. First, patients treated with different PD-1 inhibitors (i.e. nivolumab or pembrolizumab) are eligible, as these drugs are considered interchangeable based on OS and AEs [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Second, as 
 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET/CT is often performed for initial staging of melanoma, low-dose CT is allowed as baseline scan in strictly prespecified cases. Third, for response evaluation, RECIST instead of immune-based response criteria (iRECIST) is used, as iRECIST is not yet applied in daily clinical practice [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Fourth, the study was not designed as randomised controlled trial to compare outcomes of patients with early discontinuation of PD-1 blockade with the outcomes of patients treated for two years. As patients usually have access to a treatment duration of two years, randomisation to early discontinuation of PD-1 blockade was considered not feasible in this setting. Furthermore, as an increasing number of physicians discontinue PD-1 blockade early on an individual basis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], this trial design facilitates shared decision making and may prevent overtreatment, thereby potentially reducing AEs and the number of hospital visits. The decision to early discontinue PD-1 blockade in patients with tumour response is based on pre-specified criteria and patients' wishes.
