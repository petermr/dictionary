<p id="Par38">Shorter treatment duration with PD-1 blockade would yield several major advantages since the long treatment duration of PD-1 blockade has a high impact on patients, healthcare systems, and healthcare costs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].. First, treatment with PD-1 blockade is associated with a broad spectrum of AEs (e.g. pneumonitis, colitis, nephritis, and endocrinopathies), which can develop rapidly, severely, and can be, although rare, even fatal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Some of these AEs can persist lifelong (e.g. hypothyroidism, type 1 diabetes). Although the incidence of these immune-related AEs is not associated with the dose of PD-1 blockade, the incidence gradually increases with treatment duration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Second, PD-1 blockers are intravenously (IV) administered at the outpatient clinic regularly with intervals of 2, 3, 4, or 6 weeks, which may significantly affect patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL), productivity, and time of informal caregivers. Third, a treatment duration of ≥ 2 years is associated with high costs for expensive drugs, IV treatment administration, personnel, and management of treatment-related AEs.
