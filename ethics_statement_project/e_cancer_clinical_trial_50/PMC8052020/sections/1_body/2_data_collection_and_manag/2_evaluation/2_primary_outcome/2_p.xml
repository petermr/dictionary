<p>The primary outcome will be the form of faces every day. The BSFS (Bristol Stool Form Scale)
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]
 </sup> will be used to assess patients' face form before, during and after the intervention. A higher BSF score indicates soft feces: 1 to 2 points indicate constipation, 3 to 4 points indicate normal feces, and 5 to 7 points indicate diarrhea.
