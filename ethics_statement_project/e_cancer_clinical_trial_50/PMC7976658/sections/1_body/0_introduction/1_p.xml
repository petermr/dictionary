<p id="Par10">Once the classical paradigm for rectal cancer treatment was; 'The lower the cancer, the worse its prognosis'. Nowadays equivalent oncological outcomes can be achieved for all rectal cancer patients, no matter its height and even with sphincter preserving options. The first one to describe the APER or Abdomino Perineal Excision of Rectum was Sir W. E. Miles in 1908 and for a century this procedure remained the gold standard for the treatment of cancers of the lower rectum. Over the last few decades the surgical management of distal rectal cancer has shifted from the traditional APER or Miles procedure to low or even ultralow sphincter-preserving anterior resections (LAR, uLAR) [
