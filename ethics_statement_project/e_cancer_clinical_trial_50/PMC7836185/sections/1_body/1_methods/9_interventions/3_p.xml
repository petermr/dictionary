<p id="Par26">Health workers conducting cervical cancer screening at the local health facility in the intervention group will receive orientation about the study to make sure that the women attending the health facility receive screening. They will ensure that the equipment is functional and reagents are available, record information, provide psychosocial counseling to the case positives, and refer for further confirmation and treatment. The recorded information at the health facility will be tallied using the referral slip to confirm women’s participation for cervical cancer screening. The collected data will be kept strictly confidential and will only be accessed by the members of the trial team.</p>
