<p id="Par19">Clusters will be randomly assigned to intervention and control areas using a 1:1 allocation ratio. Randomization will be done before the participants are recruited. Research teams responsible for identifying potential participants, obtaining consent, and recruiting trial participants will be blinded to the participants' allocation status. The following steps will be taken to avoid selection bias during random allocation: (a) clusters will be randomized only after the baseline survey, (b) clusters will not be withdrawn from or added to the study, and (c) a statistician from abroad who is not familiar to the study will randomize the clusters.</p>
