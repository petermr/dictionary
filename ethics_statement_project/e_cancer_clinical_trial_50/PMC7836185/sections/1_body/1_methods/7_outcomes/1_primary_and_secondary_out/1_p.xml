<p id="Par21">The primary outcome of the study is percentage change in cervical cancer screening uptake from baseline to follow-up in the intervention group compared to the control group in a 12-month home-based health education intervention. The baseline survey will be conducted before the cluster randomization, and a follow-up survey of similar method will be conducted after 12-month intervention. The response of each participant for cervical cancer screening in the baseline survey and the follow-up survey will be compared to evaluate the percentage. In addition, FCHV will provide a referral slip to the participants in the intervention group (keeping a copy of the referral slip to submit to the field supervisor) during the home visit, which they take with them and submit to the health facility for VIA screening. The referral slip contains study code, name, age, address, and signature of both FCHV and the participant. FCHV will inform the participants about the health facility where the services are freely available. The key health personnel providing the VIA screening services are oriented about the study. Furthermore, confidentiality about the participants' information will be maintained throughout the intervention. The field supervisor will collect the referral slip to confirm that the participants have received VIA screening and results from all the health facilities of the intervention ward as a reference to the participants' response.</p>
