It includes questions on survey information, consent, socio-demographic information, questions related to sexual and reproductive health, health-seeking behavior, knowledge, attitude and cervical cancer screening practice, and sign and symptoms. The questionnaire was modified as per the Nepalese settings, translated to the Nepali language and back to English to ensure content validity. Baseline data will be used for possible confounder adjustment and stratification by effect modifiers. The data enumerators will identify eligible participants, ask about their willingness to participate in the cRCT, receive informed consent, and recruit in the trial. The required number of participants will be randomly selected from those willing to participate in the cRCT: FCHVs will visit each household, meet the selected participant, and obtain consent to participate in the trial.
