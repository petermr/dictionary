 </sup> ONS can supplement the energy and protein in patients with esophageal cancer and improve their nutritional status. At present, this conclusion has been confirmed, but there is a lack of strict randomized controlled trials (RCTs). At the same time, no study has focused on the changes in patients' quality of life before and after treatment. This study will evaluate the effect of ONS on nutritional status and quality of life in patients with esophageal cancer treated undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
