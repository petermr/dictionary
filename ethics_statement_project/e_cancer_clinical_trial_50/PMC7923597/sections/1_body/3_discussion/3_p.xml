<p id="Par25">In the current trial, HIPEC did not improve the patient survival. In the multivariate survival analysis, only pathological T stage was significantly correlated with prognosis in locally advanced gastric cancer patients who underwent radical resection. HIPEC with cisplatin did not prolong patient survival in locally advanced gastric cancer. Our results are not consistent with Reutovich MY's results though the research design of these two studies was similar [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Patients in HIPEC group of the two studies were both treated with curative resection followed by intraoperative HIPEC with cisplatin. However, there were more stage III patients enrolled in Reutovich MY's study and the patients were treated with HIPEC for a longer time (60â€‰min) when compared with those in our study. A higher tumor stage indicates a higher probability of peritoneal recurrence and metastasis. The prolonged perfusion time could increase the antitumor efficacy of HIPEC. Taken together, these two studies imply that the perfusion time and selection of patients might affect the efficacy of HIPEC with cisplatin in the prevention of peritoneal recurrence. Interestingly, in our study, the percentage of patients with elevated tumor markers was significantly lower in the HIPEC group than in the control group. Since serum level of tumor markers can be used to monitor recurrence of cancer, these data suggest that HIPEC might inhibit the peritoneal recurrence.
