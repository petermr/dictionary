 <italic>, validated into Swedish GSES</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] is an instrument that asks the persons´ opinion about how he or she can deal with difficulties and challenges in life. It consists of 10 items (eg. "I can always manage to solve difficult problems if I try hard enough”, "I am confident that I could deal efficiently with unexpected events” and "I can usually handle whatever comes my way”) rated on a four-point Likert scale ("not at all true” to "exactly true”), summarized across respondents (range 10–40); higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy.
