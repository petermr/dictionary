<p id="Par16">Among women, breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In 2019, the Swedish national cancer register recorded 9225 cases of breast cancer; 9157 women and 68 men (0.7%). The incidence rate of breast cancer in Sweden is expected to continue to rise, due to an increase in both the general and ageing population numbers [

While the RT procedure itself takes only a few minutes and is painless, it requires meticulous preparation and patients then need to attend the RT treatment centre 5 days a week for up to 3–5 weeks. Moreover, in Sweden, the waiting time is often quite long, sometimes up to 10 weeks [
