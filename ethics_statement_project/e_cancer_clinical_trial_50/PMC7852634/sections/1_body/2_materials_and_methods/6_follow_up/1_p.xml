<p>All patients were followed up by telephone or clinical visit. Telephone follow-up was performed every 2 mo to document the patient's status. If a patient had new jaundice or a significant increase in total bilirubin, abdominal enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was recommended to determine stent obstruction. Follow-up continued until a patient died or the end of the study. The overall survival period was calculated from the time the stent was placed to when the patient died or the end of the study. The stent patency time was from stent placement to stent blockage or the end of the study.</p>
