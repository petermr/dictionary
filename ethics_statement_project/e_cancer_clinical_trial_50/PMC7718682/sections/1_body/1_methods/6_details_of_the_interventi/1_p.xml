<p id="Par30">The intervention design is based on the CBL literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and the research team's didactic experience. To answer the study aims of increasing the healthcare professionals' knowledge of gastrointestinal side effects and attitude toward team collaboration, we developed a case based on national guidelines, standard operating procedures and the identified learning objectives from the Delphi study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The CBL method originating from the Harvard Business School engages participants in a structured manner towards uncovering decisions process' and actions patterns [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The CBL method is ideal for healthcare professionals as discussions are part of the complex clinical decision-making process in healthcare [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. CBL sessions will not be used to teach traditionally from facilitator to healthcare professional. Rather, the didactic approach includes facilitators encouraging participants to think aloud, explain their rationales, observations, considerations and suggestions. The facilitators will guide the participants' thought process through the structure of clinical decision-making by posing questions, eliciting opinions and stimulating a discussion, so the participants themselves explore their knowledge and attitudes [
