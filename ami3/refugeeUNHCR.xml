<entry id="" term="Enforcement and Implementation (Control) Mechanisms" desc='the system for monitoring 
implementation and enforcing international human 
rights law is very diffe
rent from how states 
enforce their domestic laws. The former relies heavily
 on political pressure, a
nd it is the state, not 
individuals, which are responsible for human right
s violations. The two principle ways to treat 
human rights violations within the UN system ar
e on the one hand the enforcement and complaint

the other by approaching some of the other UN 
agencies and offices that focus on human rights.
 Complaint mechanisms exist independent from

application of the family unity principle, th
ey are said to enjoy "derivative status”'/>

<entry id="" term="Family Reunification" desc='The process of bringing together families, particularly children and

refugees are addressed without previously dete

recognition of refugee status on a prima facie 
basis and the provision of temporary protection'/>

<entry id="" term="Group Determination of Refugee Status" desc='A practice by which all persons forming part of a large-

common problems to humanitarian actors, and administering coordination mech
